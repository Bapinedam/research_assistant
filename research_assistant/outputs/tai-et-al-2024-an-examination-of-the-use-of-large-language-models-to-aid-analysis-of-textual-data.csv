The iterative approach leverages LLM stochasticity to approximate population-level coding trends, and the LLMq metric stabilizes with sufficient iterations (typically beyond 40).

As LLMs and training datasets expand, scalability and reliability are expected to improve, facilitating efficient large-scale qualitative analysis."
