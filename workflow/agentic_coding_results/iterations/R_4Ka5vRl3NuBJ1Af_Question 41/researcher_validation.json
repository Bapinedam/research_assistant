  "feedback": "The final coding decision does not fully align with the student response or the iteration results. While the final decision focuses solely on 'Importance' under the Value theme, it overlooks key aspects of the student's response, such as the potential for combining feedback to achieve better outcomes. Additionally, the iterations highlight other relevant codes like 'Speed' and 'Reliable,' which are not addressed in the final decision. The reasoning provided in the final decision is accurate but incomplete, as it does not account for the broader context of the student's response.",
  "discrepancies": [
    "The final decision omits relevant codes such as 'Speed' and 'Reliable' identified in iterations 2 and 3.",
    "The final decision does not address the student's mention of combining feedback for better outcomes, which could align with a different theme or sub-theme.",
    "The reasoning in the final decision is narrow and does not fully capture the nuances of the student's response."
  ],
  "recommendations": [
    "Incorporate additional codes such as 'Speed' and 'Reliable' to reflect the full scope of the student's response.",
    "Consider adding a code or reasoning related to the student's mention of combining feedback for better outcomes.",
    "Ensure that the final decision aligns more closely with the iteration results and captures all relevant aspects of the response."
