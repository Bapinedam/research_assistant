      "reasoning": "The student mentions that GenAI 'allowed me to take my time to ask for feedbacks and any follow-up questions,' which directly indicates a more convenient and accessible process for obtaining feedback. This aligns with the Ease code."

      "reasoning": "The student describes an 'unspoken pressure to keep the question/answer process to be efficient' when interacting with teachers, which suggests a sense of vulnerability or fear of judgment. This aligns with the Risky code, as it reflects relational risks in the feedback process with teachers."
