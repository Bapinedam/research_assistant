  "feedback": "The final coding decision is accurate and aligns well with the framework. The reasoning provided is clear and directly tied to the student's response, effectively capturing the 'Unaware' code. The analysis is consistent with the iteration results, and the decision adheres to the coding strategy by focusing on the explicit lack of awareness expressed in the response. No additional codes are necessary as the student's statement does not indicate any preference or other themes.",
