      "reasoning": "The statement 'teachers search more for the greater meaning of a piece of work' and 'attempt to understand the ideology and thought process behind the work' consistently indicates that teacher feedback encourages deeper critical thinking and self-examination. This aligns with the Reflection code, which captures feedback that fosters deeper consideration of one's learning or work. The reasoning is consistent across all iterations and adheres to the coding framework."
