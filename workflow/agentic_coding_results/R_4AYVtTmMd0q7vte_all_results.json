For example, \"GenAI is available 24/7\" is coded for Ease, while \"responds instantly\" is coded for Speed.\n\n3. **Focus on Comparison**  \n   - The response explicitly compares GenAI and teacher feedback in terms of accessibility and response time, which is captured in the codes.\n\n4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Logic**  \n   - Each code includes all three required components:\n     - **Actor**: Clearly identifies whether the feedback refers to GenAI (A) or teachers (T).\n     - **Comparator**: Indicates whether the actor is associated with \"More\" or \"Less\" of the characteristic.\n     - **Characteristic**: Captures the specific property being described (Ease, Speed).\n\n5. **Reasoning**  \n   - The reasoning for each code is clear and directly tied to the text of the response. For example:\n     - \"GenAI is available 24/7\" is linked to Ease because it reflects convenience and lack of barriers.\n     - \"responds instantly\" is linked to Speed because it highlights immediacy.\n\n### Final Assessment:\nThis output is a strong example of proper coding. It adheres to the coding strategy, captures the nuances of the response, and provides clear reasoning for each code. No revisions are necessary.",
