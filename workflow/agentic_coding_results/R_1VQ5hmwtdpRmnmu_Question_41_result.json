For example, the reasoning for \"No impact\" directly ties to the phrase \"GenAI is designed to be neutral.\"\n\n2. **Chunk-Based Coding**: Each chunk of the response is coded once, and the codes are distinct, addressing different aspects of the feedback.\n\n3. **Focus on Comparison**: The response explicitly compares AI and teacher feedback in terms of emotional impact, which is captured in the codes.\n\n4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Logic**: Each code includes all three components:\n   - **Actor**: Clearly identifies whether the feedback refers to AI (A) or Teacher (T).\n   - **Comparator**: Indicates whether the feedback is \"More\" or \"Less\" impactful or neutral.\n   - **Characteristic**: Focuses on the emotional impact (positive, negative, or no impact).\n\n5. **Reasoning**: The reasoning for each code is clear and directly tied to the student's response, ensuring transparency in the coding process.\n\nThis output effectively captures the nuances of the student's response while adhering to the coding strategy."
