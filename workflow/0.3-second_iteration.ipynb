    "        **Actor** – Who or what the comment refers to (A = AI, T = Teacher, B = Both).  \n",
    "        **Comparator** – The relative position (e.g., more, less, similar, better, worse).  \n",
    "        **Characteristic** – The feedback property being described (e.g., clarity, accuracy, relevance, timeliness, emotional safety).  \n",
    "    - A valid coded chunk must include all three components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Handling Unusable Responses**  \n",
    "    - If a response is unintelligible or does not appear to answer the question, code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",

    "    When coding student responses:\n",
    "    1. **Surface-Level Understanding**  \n",
    "    - Keep interpretations minimal: code *only* what is directly and explicitly stated.  \n",
    "    - Do not infer hidden meanings, motivations, or consequences.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Chunk-Based Coding (Restrained)**  \n",
    "    - Divide a response only if there are **clear shifts in meaning** (e.g., “while,” “but,” “however”).  \n",
    "    - Avoid splitting into too many micro-chunks. A whole sentence is usually a single chunk.  \n",
    "    - **Max 2 chunks per sentence** unless multiple actors (AI vs Teacher) are explicitly compared.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Salience over Exhaustiveness**  \n",
    "    - Prioritize **main comparisons** or feelings.  \n",
    "    - Do not code every possible nuance if it dilutes the focus.  \n",
    "    - Example: If a chunk has both a tone (“neutral”) and an efficiency descriptor (“efficient”), select the \n",
    "        **dominant characteristic** (in this case, tone/feeling = “No impact”).\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Rule**  \n",
    "    - A valid code requires all three: Actor (A/T/B), Comparator (more/less/similar), and Characteristic (e.g., clarity, personal, timeliness).  \n",
    "    - If multiple characteristics appear but relate to the *same actor/comparator*, treat them as **one code**.  \n",
    "    - Example: \n",
    "    “Teacher’s feedback was more encouraging than ChatGPT’s” → single code: Actor = Teacher, Comparator = More, Characteristic = Positivity   \n",
    "        ###\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Dominant Coding Principle**  \n",
    "    - When multiple possible codes exist in the same chunk, select the **most prominent or emotionally central one**.  \n",
    "    - Example: \n",
    "    “GenAI felt neutral and efficient” → dominant code = “No impact” (feeling tone). “Efficient” is secondary and not coded separately.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. **Handling Unusable Responses**  \n",
    "    - If actor, comparator, or characteristic is missing, mark as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",

       "   'Response': 'Immediate Accessibility vs. Depth of Understanding:\\nGenAI: Provides instant feedback, which is great for quick answers, revision, or clarification of simple concepts. This immediate response helps with surface-level learning and understanding new topics quickly. However, it may not delve deeply into why something is correct or incorrect, which can limit deeper conceptual learning.\\nTeacher: While teacher feedback might take longer, it often fosters a deeper understanding. Teachers provide context, explain thought processes, and focus on correcting misunderstandings in a more thorough manner. This depth helps with mastering difficult topics and long-term retention.\\nAdaptability to Learning Styles:\\nGenAI: Can adapt to different inputs and provide general explanations, but lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning preferences. It often presents information in a neutral, one-size-fits-all manner, which might not always align with your learning style.\\nTeacher: Can tailor feedback to your personal learning preferences and adjust explanations based on your strengths and weaknesses. This personalized guidance can be more effective in addressing gaps in your knowledge.\\nSelf-Learning vs. Guided Learning:\\nGenAI: Encourages a degree of self-learning and exploration. Since you often have to interpret and apply the feedback yourself, it can build self-reliance and problem-solving skills. However, this may sometimes leave you without the clarity or support you need for more complex issues.\\nTeacher: Offers a more guided learning experience, ensuring you understand each step of the process. They can break down complicated problems, helping you connect concepts in ways you might not have thought of independently.\\nMotivation and Confidence:\\nGenAI: Provides neutral, objective feedback, which can be helpful, but it lacks emotional encouragement or personalized support. While it may clarify doubts, it doesn’t necessarily boost motivation or confidence as much.\\nTeacher:',\n",

A teacher can pinpoint exactly where your misunderstandings lie and offer tailored advice based on your learning history, class discussions, and personal strengths/weaknesses.\\nInteraction and Clarification:\\nGenAI: While it can provide immediate responses, any clarification requests might lead to further iterations that don’t fully address specific nuances or educational standards.\\nTeacher: Can provide real-time interaction, and their feedback can evolve during a conversation. Teachers can adapt their feedback based on your immediate questions and guide you through complex concepts interactively.\\nPersonal Context:\\nGenAI: Offers neutral and objective responses, not necessarily aware of your personal goals, context, or progress unless you provide that background explicitly.\\nTeacher: Knows your academic history, learning style, and class performance, allowing them to give feedback that aligns with your personal development and educational goals.\\nFocus on Practical Application:\\nGenAI: May provide theoretical advice and focus on ideal answers. It doesn’t always account for real-world applications or specific academic contexts unless explicitly prompted.\\nTeacher: Can emphasize the practical application of knowledge, often linking feedback to how concepts will be tested, used in projects, or applied in professional settings.',\n",
