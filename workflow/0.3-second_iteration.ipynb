    "    When coding student responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Surface-Level Understanding**  \n",
    "    - Do not over-interpret student responses.  \n",
    "    - Work from the most direct, surface-level meaning of the text.  \n",
    "    - Avoid reading beyond what is explicitly written.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Chunk-Based Coding**  \n",
    "    - Divide each response into meaningful chunks (a sentence or a significant phrase).  \n",
    "    - A chunk should only be coded once, even if it could theoretically fit multiple codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Focus on Comparison**  \n",
    "    - Prioritize identifying any comparison between AI feedback and teacher feedback.  \n",
    "    - Look for explicit or implicit comparative language such as *more, less, better, worse, easier, harder, similar*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Logic**  \n",
    "    - For each usable chunk, identify three components:  \n",
    "        **Actor** – Who or what the comment refers to (A = AI, T = Teacher, B = Both).  \n",
    "        **Comparator** – The relative position (e.g., more, less, similar, better, worse).  \n",
    "        **Characteristic** – The feedback property being described (e.g., clarity, accuracy, relevance, timeliness, emotional safety).  \n",
    "    - A valid coded chunk must include all three components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Handling Unusable Responses**  \n",
    "    - If a response is unintelligible or does not appear to answer the question, code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",
    "    - If a chunk is missing **any one** of the three required components (Actor, Comparator, Characteristic), code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",
    "    - Example of unusable: \"It was better\" – we don’t know *which actor* it refers to.  \n",

       "   'Response': 'Immediate Accessibility vs. Depth of Understanding:\\nGenAI: Provides instant feedback, which is great for quick answers, revision, or clarification of simple concepts. This immediate response helps with surface-level learning and understanding new topics quickly. However, it may not delve deeply into why something is correct or incorrect, which can limit deeper conceptual learning.\\nTeacher: While teacher feedback might take longer, it often fosters a deeper understanding. Teachers provide context, explain thought processes, and focus on correcting misunderstandings in a more thorough manner. This depth helps with mastering difficult topics and long-term retention.\\nAdaptability to Learning Styles:\\nGenAI: Can adapt to different inputs and provide general explanations, but lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning preferences. It often presents information in a neutral, one-size-fits-all manner, which might not always align with your learning style.\\nTeacher: Can tailor feedback to your personal learning preferences and adjust explanations based on your strengths and weaknesses. This personalized guidance can be more effective in addressing gaps in your knowledge.\\nSelf-Learning vs. Guided Learning:\\nGenAI: Encourages a degree of self-learning and exploration. Since you often have to interpret and apply the feedback yourself, it can build self-reliance and problem-solving skills. However, this may sometimes leave you without the clarity or support you need for more complex issues.\\nTeacher: Offers a more guided learning experience, ensuring you understand each step of the process. They can break down complicated problems, helping you connect concepts in ways you might not have thought of independently.\\nMotivation and Confidence:\\nGenAI: Provides neutral, objective feedback, which can be helpful, but it lacks emotional encouragement or personalized support. While it may clarify doubts, it doesn’t necessarily boost motivation or confidence as much.\\nTeacher:',\n",
