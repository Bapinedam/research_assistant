    "    When coding student responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. **Surface-Level Understanding**  \n",
    "    - Do not over-interpret student responses.  \n",
    "    - Work from the most direct, surface-level meaning of the text.  \n",
    "    - Avoid reading beyond what is explicitly written.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. **Chunk-Based Coding**  \n",
    "    - Divide each response into meaningful chunks (a sentence or a significant phrase).  \n",
    "    - A chunk should only be coded once, even if it could theoretically fit multiple codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. **Focus on Comparison**  \n",
    "    - Prioritize identifying any comparison between AI feedback and teacher feedback.  \n",
    "    - Look for explicit or implicit comparative language such as *more, less, better, worse, easier, harder, similar*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Logic**  \n",
    "    - For each usable chunk, identify three components:  \n",
    "        **Actor** – Who or what the comment refers to (A = AI, T = Teacher, B = Both).  \n",
    "        **Comparator** – The relative position (e.g., more, less, similar, better, worse).  \n",
    "        **Characteristic** – The feedback property being described (e.g., clarity, accuracy, relevance, timeliness, emotional safety).  \n",
    "    - A valid coded chunk must include all three components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "    5. **Handling Unusable Responses**  \n",
    "    - If a response is unintelligible or does not appear to answer the question, code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",
    "    - If a chunk is missing **any one** of the three required components (Actor, Comparator, Characteristic), code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",
    "    - Example of unusable: \"It was better\" – we don’t know *which actor* it refers to.  \n",
