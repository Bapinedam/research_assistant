    "CODING_STRATEGY = \"\"\"\n",
    "When coding student responses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Surface-Level Understanding**  \n",
    "   - Do not over-interpret student responses.  \n",
    "   - Work from the most direct, surface-level meaning of the text.  \n",
    "   - Avoid reading beyond what is explicitly written.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Chunk-Based Coding**  \n",
    "   - Divide each response into meaningful chunks (a sentence or a significant phrase).  \n",
    "   - A chunk should only be coded once, even if it could theoretically fit multiple codes.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Focus on Comparison**  \n",
    "   - Prioritize identifying any comparison between AI feedback and teacher feedback.  \n",
    "   - Look for explicit or implicit comparative language such as *more, less, better, worse, easier, harder, similar*.  \n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Logic**  \n",
    "   - For each usable chunk, identify three components:  \n",
    "       **Actor** – Who or what the comment refers to (A = AI, T = Teacher, B = Both).  \n",
    "       **Comparator** – The relative position (e.g., more, less, similar, better, worse).  \n",
    "       **Characteristic** – The feedback property being described (e.g., clarity, accuracy, relevance, timeliness, emotional safety).  \n",
    "   - A valid coded chunk must include all three components.  \n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Handling Unusable Responses**  \n",
    "   - If a response is unintelligible or does not appear to answer the question, code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",
    "   - If a chunk is missing **any one** of the three required components (Actor, Comparator, Characteristic), code it as **UNUSABLE**.  \n",
    "   - Example of unusable: \"It was better\" – we don’t know *which actor* it refers to.  \n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Special Case: Question 43 (Reason for Not Using GenAI)**  \n",
    "   - For responses to Question 43, the focus is on identifying **clear reasons** why students did not use AI.  \n",
    "   - If no clear reason is provided, or the response is unintelligible, mark it as **UNUSABLE**.\n",
