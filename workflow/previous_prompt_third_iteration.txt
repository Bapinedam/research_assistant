                The aim of this study is to investigate how university students use, value, and trust feedback generated by Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) 
                compared to feedback from teachers. Specifically, the research seeks to understand the different roles that GenAI and teacher feedback play in 
                higher education, the factors that influence students’ perceptions of their usefulness, reliability, and trustworthiness, and the ways in which these 
                forms of feedback shape students’ learning experiences, emotions, and engagement with feedback processes.

    - Avoid reading beyond what is explicitly written.

    2. **Chunk-Based Coding**  
    - Divide each response into meaningful chunks (a sentence or a significant phrase).  
    - A chunk should only be coded once, even if it could theoretically fit multiple codes.

    3. **Focus on Comparison**  
    - Prioritize identifying any comparison between AI feedback and teacher feedback.  
    - Look for explicit or implicit comparative language such as *more, less, better, worse, easier, harder, similar*.  

    4. **Actor + Comparator + Characteristic Logic**  
    - For each usable chunk, identify three components:  
        **Actor** – Who or what the comment refers to (A = AI, T = Teacher, B = Both).  
        **Comparator** – The relative position (e.g., more, less, similar, better, worse).  
        **Characteristic** – The feedback property being described (e.g., clarity, accuracy, relevance, timeliness, emotional safety).  
    - A valid coded chunk must include all three components.  

    5. **Handling Unusable Responses**  
    - If a response is unintelligible or does not appear to answer the question, code it as **UNUSABLE**.  
    - If a chunk is missing **any one** of the three required components (Actor, Comparator, Characteristic), code it as **UNUSABLE**.  
    - Example of unusable: "It was better" – we don’t know *which actor* it refers to.

                ### Code: Unaware
                **Definition:** Respondents didn’t know GenAI could provide feedback; or didn’t know how to use it; or didn’t think of using it.  
                **Representative quotes:**
                - “Didn’t think to” (BC26)

                ### Code: Effortful
                **Definition:** Too much effort to use AI or learn how to use AI; don’t have time to use AI (e.g., last-minute assignments).

                - “It is more effort than it's worth to program it to understand the confines and requirements of the work/project.” (BC7731)

                ### Code: Less effort
                **Definition:** Off-loads effort or experience of learning, which in this context is not desirable.  
                **Representative quotes:**
                - “I'm paying substantial fees to undertake this course, I figure if I can't push myself to do the entirety of the work myself and mam relying on AI, then I am not gaining the skills I need to enter the workforce.” (BC2044)  
                - “Because I need to learn new things with some effort. Using GenAI for work is something like I'm not using my calibre to do the work. So in order to be part of this competitive world I should hold and thrive myself with my effort.” (BC2342)  
                - “It is because I want to use my own intelligence to learn something new instead of depending on AI and only get marks without knowing why.” (BC2857)

                ### Code: In-depth
                **Definition:** Not enough, or sometimes not useful because it offers too much depth or additional explanation than desired.  
                **Representative quote:**

                - “I find it is not helpful in most circumstances as it tends to pull information from outside what I enter into the search engine.” (BC5060)  
                - “I feel like it's not going to help me in the feedback I need. It will just pick up on expression mistakes, which I can use through someone proof reading my work.” (BC7775)

                ### Code: Trustworthy
                **Definition:** Respondent does not trust the information; it is not reliable, or the provider/source is not competent to provide trustworthy information.  
                **Representative quotes:**
                - “I didn’t use GenAI for feedback on my work because I do not trust that it would be accurate” (BC3)  
                - “I would not trust GenAI to give me the correct answer or feedback” (BC17)

                - “I rather take feedback from a professional in the field” (BC5436)  
                - “Because GenAI does not hold the same human knowledge as a tut / lecturer holds, therefore does not provide the same insightful feedback.” (BC6441)

CODING_STRATEGY_43 = """

                        1) Scope & Principle

                        Goal: Identify explicit reasons for not using GenAI.

                        Surface-level only: Code the direct, literal meaning; do not infer beyond what is written.

                        2) Chunking

                        Split the response into meaningful chunks (sentence or key clause).

                        Assign one code per chunk. If multiple codes could apply, choose the most specific.

                        3) Required Fields

                        For each usable chunk, produce one reason with:

                        theme: Processes | Information | Tone | Relational | Value

                        sub_theme: Use the correct sub-theme; if not stated, repeat the theme (i.e., sub_theme = theme).

                        code: The specific characteristic (e.g., Unaware, Effortful, Less effort, Contextualised, Trustworthy, Privacy, Integrity, Unsustainable, Personal, Expert, Preference, Need, Positivity).

                        reasoning: Brief justification that quotes or precisely references the triggering phrase(s) and ties them to the code definition.
                        
                        4) Usability Rules

                        Usable: The chunk clearly states a reason for non-use (e.g., didn’t know, too hard/time, don’t trust, lacks context, not helpful, prefer human, no need, privacy, integrity, environmental concerns, style dislike).

                        UNUSABLE: Unintelligible, off-topic, or no reason stated.
