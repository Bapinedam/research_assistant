Question:
Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?

Answer:
AI's feedback was more spelling and grammar based. It didn't really try to correct my description of concepts and if it did I ignored it. Teacher feedback enabled me to learn more from the assignment and carry it over into other assessments.

Question:
Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?

Answer:
Negative feedback from the teacher is taken more personally because it comes from an actual person. AI feedback is easier to ignore.

Question:
Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.

Answer:
Teacher feedback (on an assignment) can sometimes be shorter (they have other papers to mark) but zoom in on the relevant parts of the assignment where I lost marks, AI feedback gives more general and broad insight.
