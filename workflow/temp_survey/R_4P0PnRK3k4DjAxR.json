    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I find that it's more convenient/timely to get feedback from AI. I also found that often if it's feedback that the teacher is required to give, then sometimes it feels lackluster or copy-pasted from student to student. This applied more to high school than it does at uni, but the sentiment still remains.",
