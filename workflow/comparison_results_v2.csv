R_4CKOoHgU8hp01rg;Question 40;Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?;"Immediate Accessibility vs. Depth of Understanding:
GenAI: Provides instant feedback, which is great for quick answers, revision, or clarification of simple concepts. This immediate response helps with surface-level learning and understanding new topics quickly. However, it may not delve deeply into why something is correct or incorrect, which can limit deeper conceptual learning.
Teacher: While teacher feedback might take longer, it often fosters a deeper understanding. Teachers provide context, explain thought processes, and focus on correcting misunderstandings in a more thorough manner. This depth helps with mastering difficult topics and long-term retention.
Adaptability to Learning Styles:
GenAI: Can adapt to different inputs and provide general explanations, but lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning preferences. It often presents information in a neutral, one-size-fits-all manner, which might not always align with your learning style.
Teacher: Can tailor feedback to your personal learning preferences and adjust explanations based on your strengths and weaknesses. This personalized guidance can be more effective in addressing gaps in your knowledge.
Self-Learning vs. Guided Learning:
GenAI: Encourages a degree of self-learning and exploration. Since you often have to interpret and apply the feedback yourself, it can build self-reliance and problem-solving skills. However, this may sometimes leave you without the clarity or support you need for more complex issues.
Teacher: Offers a more guided learning experience, ensuring you understand each step of the process. They can break down complicated problems, helping you connect concepts in ways you might not have thought of independently.
Motivation and Confidence:
GenAI: Provides neutral, objective feedback, which can be helpful, but it lacks emotional encouragement or personalized support. While it may clarify doubts, it doesn’t necessarily boost motivation or confidence as much.

R_4CKOoHgU8hp01rg;Question 42;Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.;"Depth of Feedback:
GenAI: Provides general and broad feedback based on the information it has been trained on, with a focus on a variety of subjects and technical accuracy. It may offer suggestions for improving clarity, structure, and logic, but sometimes lacks detailed, personalized insight.
Teacher: Offers more specific, individualized feedback. A teacher can pinpoint exactly where your misunderstandings lie and offer tailored advice based on your learning history, class discussions, and personal strengths/weaknesses.
Interaction and Clarification:
GenAI: While it can provide immediate responses, any clarification requests might lead to further iterations that don’t fully address specific nuances or educational standards.
Teacher: Can provide real-time interaction, and their feedback can evolve during a conversation. Teachers can adapt their feedback based on your immediate questions and guide you through complex concepts interactively.
Personal Context:
GenAI: Offers neutral and objective responses, not necessarily aware of your personal goals, context, or progress unless you provide that background explicitly.
Teacher: Knows your academic history, learning style, and class performance, allowing them to give feedback that aligns with your personal development and educational goals.
Focus on Practical Application:
GenAI: May provide theoretical advice and focus on ideal answers. It doesn’t always account for real-world applications or specific academic contexts unless explicitly prompted.
Teacher: Can emphasize the practical application of knowledge, often linking feedback to how concepts will be tested, used in projects, or applied in professional settings.";['A-more', 'T-more', 'A-less', 'T-more'];['Speed', 'Contextualised', 'Relevance', 'Personal'];['A-less', 'T-more', 'T-more', 'A-more', 'A-less', 'T-more', 'T-more', 'A-more', 'T-more', 'T-more', 'A-less', 'A-more', 'T-more', 'A-less'];['In-depth', 'Specificity', 'Personal', 'Speed', 'Less effort', 'Less effort', 'Expert', 'Objective', 'Personal', 'Contextualised', 'Contextualised', 'Reliable', 'Utility', 'Utility'];['Information', 'Information', 'Relational', 'Processes', 'Processes', 'Processes', 'Relational', 'Information', 'Relational', 'Information', 'Information', 'Information', 'Information', 'Information'];['Quality', 'Quality', 'Relational', 'Access', 'Effort', 'Effort', 'Relational', 'Quality', 'Relational', 'Quality', 'Quality', 'Quality', 'Quality', 'Quality'];"[""The statement 'sometimes lacks detailed, personalized insight' indicates that GenAI provides less comprehensive and nuanced feedback compared to teachers.
