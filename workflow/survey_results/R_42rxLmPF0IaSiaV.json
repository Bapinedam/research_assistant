    "Question": "Why didn’t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I don’t believe that AI is effectively able to judge my work in accordance to a marking guide such as a rubric or guide set by my unit chair. I think it may be useful for rewording such as development of language and punctuation but i feel confident in my level of language to be able to get my point across precisely and accurately, whilst using the right language. For this reason, I would prefer to judge my work myself of through a person such as a tutor, as they can understand what is needed from the task such as a rubric and effectively provide feedback on areas to improve and what to adapt in my piece.",
