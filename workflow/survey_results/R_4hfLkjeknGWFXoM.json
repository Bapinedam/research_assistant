  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The teacher with \"ok\" makes me frustrated at times as it is not known if i had done well or averagely. The \"ok\" does not explain a lot and was the reason we were taught in school not to reply as such. GenAI provides value and constructive feedback - which they generally do not provide negative ones. They are generally very reassuring which can sometimes lead to overconfidence.",
