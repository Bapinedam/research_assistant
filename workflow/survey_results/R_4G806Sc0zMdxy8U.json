    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is RIGHT THERE and so good at finding objective issues. For instance in my computer science subjects, GenAI is so powerful when it comes to error checking code that it could take a TA 10 minutes to find. Though in my more subjective units AIs ideas about what will earn a good grade is less applicable than my TA who will be grading it.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I don't think feedback from any source makes me feel very strongly. It's objective and not meant to make one feel happy/sad.",
