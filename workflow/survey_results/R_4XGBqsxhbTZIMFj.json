    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "1. Timely - I can get feedback before I do another assessment (sometimes feedback takes a long time to get)\n2. More specific/more indepth - Teachers mark a lot of assessments so they can't talk about every little thing.\n3. More conversational - I can talk to it about different things I did, different approaches I could do next time and overall just get more like you would if you had a conversation with ur teacher.",
