    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "As a student that is currently studying my Bachelors in Architectural Design, we are used to in-person feedback by our peers or mentors. As a design student I believe it is hard for an AI to fully understand the brief of what one/client may want. It is about understanding the design process and the needs of what the client discusses with us as an architect, with work that is always progressing.",
