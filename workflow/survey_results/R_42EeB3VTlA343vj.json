  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback brings everything back to course content/marking, however, sometimes inconsistent in what is said, especially between different teachers. GenAI feedback is really helpful with the general concepts, however, can miss those points on how it relates precisely to the course content/marking and sometimes gets details wrong.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI is less personal, so it feels safer to ask embarrassing and challenging questions. From a teacher it can feel scary to ask sometimes, even the most approachable and kind teachers still feel induce anxiety because it is personal.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "It feels safer to be wrong with GenAI when asking questions. However, a good teacher can not be replaced by GenAI as they can relate everything to the course and guide through marking which GenAI can not. GenAI is helpful as the quality can remain constant, whereas feedback from a teacher is highly dependent on their skill of teaching and personality.",
