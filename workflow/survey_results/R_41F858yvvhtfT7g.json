    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI is simply more readily available at all times to check any type of work and give instant feedback. This feedback however is not always 100% accurate or trustworthy and it takes time to fact check and ensure that it is correct feedback. This is not a worry with teachers who can be trusted with feedback 99% of the time. I do, however, want to point out that I do believe AI will be more accurate in the future.",
