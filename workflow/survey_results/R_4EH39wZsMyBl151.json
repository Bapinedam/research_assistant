    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI is always available to me, and university lecturers are nearly impossible to get time with. It has accelerated my learning as I can keep asking questions. It has also given me access to guides and step-by-step instructions that would be time-consuming to find. In summary, it has accelerated my practical technical abilities with technical software.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes, I have fun with the AI. However, having positive feedback from my supervisor is a far more wonderful validationâ€”standard course lecturers are rarely able to engage with individuals.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI is just written to be nice (at least if you are nice to it), but it is still rewarding to have it be so affirming! If you ever get positive feedback from a lecturer, it is worth way more as it is really more valid. But the difference in accessibility is the key - 24/7 access versus teeny tiny availability.",
