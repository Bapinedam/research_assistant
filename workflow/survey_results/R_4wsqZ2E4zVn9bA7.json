    "Response": "GenAI helps me to be more proactive in my learning process, asking the right questions and critical thinking.\n\nTeachers are helpful. However, they cannot provide very detailed answers to your assessments because they are not allowed to view them before submitting them (I know it's quite absurd, however, it happens in almost every uni).",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI provides thorough feedback on how I could improve to maximise my scores while the teachers do not, only highlighting the strengths. I need to email one of my teachers to ask for more feedback as the one he gave me was not thorough enough, especially on the areas for improvements.",
