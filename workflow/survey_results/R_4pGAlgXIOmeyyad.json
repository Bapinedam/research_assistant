  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I think a teacher will always be honest with you whether to give a appreciation or to positively criticise you about what you are doing but I feel GenAI will always try to make you feel better about your input and that can be a bit problematic if you are too dependent on this. One has to always keep his/her mind clear on their own and should not rely all over on GenAI",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "If I may recall a incident about an assessment that I was given , so I checked it up with my GenAI and I received a feedback and examples that I didn’t find relevant but my teacher made my thoughts clear on that. But on the other side, once I was not satisfied with my teacher on how he wants us to express ourselves in our assessment but GenAI helped me more on that case . So I think there’s always two sides of a coin so we have to make a clear side on our own that what is better for us and should act accordingly.",
