    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Tutors are much more involved in the learning experience compared to lecturers. GenAI has the advantage of personally being able to answer a question that is unique to you, whereas the teacher must be strategic so as to give all students equal opportunity for feedback.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI is much more suited to providing information in different ways than the initial way it was presented. Unfortunately, it is also very confident in answers that are objectively wrong. When corrected, it will not seek out new information. I.e. it doesn't learn in real time (at least from my experience)",
