    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is always available and doesn't judge me based on my questions. It's also autocomplete on steriods, with the entire internet as it's sample, so calling it reliable is so wrong it's hilarious. It's wonderful for things like generating code, particularly boilerplate code. But for higher-order thinking, it cannot do it on it's own. It is, however, wonderful for bouncing ideas off of. In fact, a large part of what I use it for is just a sounding board. I only really ask it to create stuff if it's tedious, or if i'm genuinely out of my depth",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback is almost always supportive, but I know they're humans. GenAI is almost definitely wrong in some part, but is always available and is always very supportive of me, even when I've been frustrated with it",
