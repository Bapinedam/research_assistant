    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I have ADHD and auditory processing difficulties so I often need things repeated to actually process the information. I feel comfortable with asking GenAI to clarify something multiple times whereas if I ask a teacher a question and I still don't understand I'd be less inclined to get them to repeat themselves again because they often (rightfully so) get annoyed and I would be left not knowing so it's helped me fill those gaps in learning.",
