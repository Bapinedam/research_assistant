    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback was somewhat helpful, but as it is generated by an artificial source it does not give the nuances that a teacher, as a human resource, can give. Therefore, the teacher as a resource for my learning is much more helpful and I am able to access better tips, as a teacher can tailor their answer to my questions.",

    "Response": "The feedback from the teacher makes me feel more reassured, as a teacher can understand the nuances of the questions i am asking and how it relates to my units. The feedback from GenAI was helpful, but not the same.",
