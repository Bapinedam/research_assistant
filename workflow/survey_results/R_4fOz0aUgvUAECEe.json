    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI and my teacher each had their own perks. GenAI gave me instant answers and personalized feedback anytime, which was awesome for quick help and deep dives into topics. But my teacher brought a human touch, understanding my struggles, offering encouragement, and making complex ideas easier with real-life examples. So, while GenAI was great for immediate support, my teacher’s guidance was key for deeper understanding and motivation.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Absolutely! Feedback from GenAI felt more like a quick, straightforward nudge in the right direction, while my teacher’s feedback had that personal touch, making it feel more encouraging and tailored to me. Both were helpful, but my teacher’s feedback felt more like a warm conversation.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "One significant difference is that GenAI feedback is super quick and to the point, which is great for getting instant help. On the other hand, my teacher’s feedback often includes more detailed explanations and examples, making it easier to understand complex topics. Plus, my teacher can pick up on my emotions and adjust their feedback accordingly, which makes it feel more supportive and personalized.",
