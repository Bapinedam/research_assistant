    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It's much easier to understand difficult concepts and ensure you are doings things correctly from learning from your teacher as oppose to AI, however, sometimes it's far easier and much more convenient to just use AI, even if it can't explain things as well and even if it takes longer to understand.",

    "Response": "Unlike school, I usually don't have any sort of personal connection with my TAs or Professors, so theirs no emotional response in terms of how the feedback made me feel between AI and the teachers.",
