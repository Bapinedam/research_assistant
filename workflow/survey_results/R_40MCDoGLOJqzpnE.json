    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Learning from a teacher is much more personal and it is generally easier for them to understand what I need help with, however the teacher is not always available. On the other hand, GenAI is always available, but often struggles to understand what I need help with and sometimes give untrustworthy information that requires fact checking.",
