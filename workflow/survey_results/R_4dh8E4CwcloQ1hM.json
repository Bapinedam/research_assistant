    "Response": "I don't trust any feedback from GenAI because it was always a praise and not criticism. Not to mention they are unreliable and based off their feedback from obscure source. Feedback from my teacher, in the contrary, based on their opinion after they read my actual work so at least they made their opinions based on that.",
