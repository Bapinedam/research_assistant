    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "One of the significant advantages of GenAI is its ability to provide real-time feedback, which is especially valuable in learning and problem-solving. When faced with uncertainties or doubts about an answer, you can ask GenAI for assistance at any time, and it will respond immediately. For example, it might offer a framework to guide you step by step through solving a problem or suggest improvements to an existing answer. However, GenAI also has its drawbacks, namely that its responses are not always accurate and may even be fabricated. Therefore, when using GenAI, it's crucial to rely on your existing knowledge to assess and verify the answers it provides.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from a teacher is always precise, detailed, and indisputable. In contrast, GenAI does not always provide high-quality or accurate responses, requiring users to exercise their own judgment and discernment. However, its greatest advantage lies in real-time interaction, with no limitations on time or location. This aspect often enhances the efficiency of learning.",
