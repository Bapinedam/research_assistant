    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The main benefit is the availability and speed of response, for instance if a topic is quite difficult to understand, you could write a prompt for GenAI to explain the topic in simple terms with examples, as opposed to sending an email to your teacher. Thus, it enhances this aspect of learning.",
