    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is readily available and does not require any wait time for response however it will never be 100% accurate to what we are learning in class so it can be used as another tool to aid you but I will always rely mostly on my teachers for help as they know exactly what it is I need to do to improve or get marks on an assignment. \n\nSo it has improved my learning somewhat but it does not replace a teacher.",

    "Response": "GenAI is only able to provide with general feedback and feedback based on the parameters that I set so it will never be perfect, mostly just do gauge where I stand in terms of a grade\n\nA teacher will be very specific and personal giving exact details and to how I can improve to either get a better mark or improve a certain skill.",
