    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Considering the teacher sets the learning criteria, the teacher’s feedback will always be more useful than a generative AI’s. Generative AI (Claude sonnet 3.5/gpt 4o) does not give as refined feedback as a tutor/lecturer and often does not give feedback that is relevant or at a university level. Allowed for me to summarise notes faster (if required) and allowed me to transpile simple programs.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI’s feedback is unreliable and not at a university level. Gen AI’s feedback is good for semantic corrections but not for critique on techniques used or ideas.",
