    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Not always the GenAI feedback is good and reliable. It sometimes gives very broad and vague feedback. So, the  feedback is not necessarily applicable to my specific context. In contrary, due to the expertise of my supervisor and knowledge about the specific context, they give more helpful feedback.",
