    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The immediate access to GenAI greatly improved my access to feedback, even when the quality of the feedback isn't as deep as what a good teacher might provide. However, it's often better than a bad teacher as well, raising the bar for the kind of feedback I can receive in certain classes.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI is a coin toss about hallucinations. Some teachers are a coin toss about patience/time/language barrier. Nothing beats a good teacher, but when approached with good AI literacy, GenAI is a powerful tool for assisting with work and receiving feedback.",
