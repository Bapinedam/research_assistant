    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI: The feedback from GenAI was immediate, detailed, and diverse in its approach. It helped in solving problems quickly and exploring different angles I hadn’t considered, especially when dealing with technical or programming-related challenges. The ability to get instant responses and revisit them at any time was valuable for improving my work.\nUniversity teacher: Teacher feedback was more nuanced and based on a deep understanding of both the subject matter and my personal learning style. Their guidance was often focused on broader concepts and long-term understanding, helping to refine my critical thinking.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI: The feedback was often accurate, especially for technical or factual queries. However, there were moments where I had to cross-check information, particularly when it came to complex theoretical concepts or specialized subjects.\nUniversity teacher: The teacher's feedback was highly trustworthy, as it came from a subject-matter expert with real-world experience. I rarely felt the need to question their advice, and they could provide context beyond what was available through just facts.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI: It encouraged me to be more self-reliant, facilitating immediate exploration of new concepts and offering a breadth of knowledge. However, it sometimes lacked the depth or focus on the conceptual frameworks that teachers emphasize.\nUniversity teacher: The teacher’s feedback often guided me to think critically, beyond just solving a problem. It helped me develop a deeper understanding of the subject and challenged my assumptions in a way that enhanced my long-term learning.",
