    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I felt it wasn't necessary to check my work through AI, and it also goes against the code of conduct at UQ to use AI in the generation of answers for assessment. I rely on feedback from lectures and my peers to improve quality of work as I feel accountability for my performance and want a true reflection of my capacity, such that I can utilise post-submission feedback optimally. I also feel that GenAI may deviate from the specificity of the assignment, and uni coordinators often emphasis key points that would improve marks awarded.",
