    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I feel as though asking too many questions to a teacher via email, or spending large amounts of time in class asking teachers questions can slow the lesson down and the teacher may get frustrated after needing to explain a concept a few times. Where AI can always reword an example and use different analogies to tie a concept to the real world, at least in my experience. And I can delve deeper into individual faucets of a complicated concept and break it down as far as required and in as much time as needed when doing personal study.",

    "Response": "AI Is good at learning from past responses and is happy to take on criticism on presentation of information at any time, whereas you can’t tell a PHD lecturer they’re a bad explainer.",

    "Response": "Obviously presenting questions to a real human has its benefits, but for quick responses I would rather an AI at this point in time. Please dont replace teachers with AI however, I will always prefer an in person lecture to an AI generated / solely online course,",
