    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "University lecturers or teachers are very distant to their students which encourages usage of tools like AI. Thus, on the rare occasion I need something explained to me ‘better’ I may resort to AI with skepticism of course. And even then I don’t trust it, which leads to a very unclear idea of what we’re meant to learn or do.",
