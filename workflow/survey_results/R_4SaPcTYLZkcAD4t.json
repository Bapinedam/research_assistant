    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Generative AI was good for immediate feedback. But I only take it as a suggestion because sometimes the feedback is inaccurate. \nI only get feedback from teachers after I’ve submitted an assignment but I do usually think of it as trustworthy.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from generative AI is easier to receive because the AI speaks very “gently”. Teacher feedback is usually harsher sounding and can make me feel more upset when it’s negative.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teachers obviously have a lot of assignments to mark, usually, so their feedback is usually very brief. Sometimes I have to contact them for more in-depth feedback or clarification. On the other hand, generative AI provides very detailed feedback.",
