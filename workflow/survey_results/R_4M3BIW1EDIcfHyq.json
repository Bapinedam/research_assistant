    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback made me feel more aware of my mistakes and helped me bridge certain gaps in subsequent assignments. I'm more likely to ignore the feedback from my teacher because I know it's more likely to make me feel bad and like I don't know what to do to fix my work.",
