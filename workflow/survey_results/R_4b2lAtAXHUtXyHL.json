    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Mostly, the feedback from GenAI provide revised version of my work, so it do not give me a time to think critically to proved revised version by my own. In addition, it sometimes generate wrong answer, so I still need to re-check the answer. It takes time. \nFeedback from teacher, on the other hand, is critical feedback. so, I have time too generate better work by my own thought and improve my critical thinking.",
