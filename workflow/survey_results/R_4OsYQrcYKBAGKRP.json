    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I just haven't felt like the AI would be able to understand the nuances of whatever rubric was being used for the assignment if it was a written one. And I've found chatgpt makes mistakes with math equations especially ones involving calculus so I tend not to use it for tasks involving math.",
