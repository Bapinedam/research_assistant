    "Response": "GenAI offers instant, personalized responses and 24/7 availability, while teachers provide deeper insights, emotional support, and tailored feedback based on long-term progress. GenAI excels in delivering information quickly, but teachers bring human interaction and adapt lessons in real time. Both are valuable, complementing each other in the learning process.",
