    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers are usually v vague and tell us ton \"figure it out, you're smart\" which is not really helpful when you are getting your assignment done and need a good grade, doesn't matter if I'm a smart person or not. GenAI provides what you ask in a clear manner and explains it well. This helps us to learn without judgement and pre-labels on ourselves.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Like mentioned above GenAI is a lot less stress inducing. You get what you exactly asked and you can move on to completing your studies.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI is to the point, gives exactly what you need to hear. Whereas teachers tend to give feedback based on the students themselves and not their work, but this is sometimes a good thing when a student is being hard on themselves.",
