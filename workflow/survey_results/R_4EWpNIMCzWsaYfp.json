    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I dont trust its accuracy. Rubbish in = rubbish out. But it is interesting to see what AI produces about a topic that has been little researched, to see what types of information it pulls. I also want to learn. I wont learn as much if AI does the learning for me, by making adjustments that I dont understand the reasoning behind.",
