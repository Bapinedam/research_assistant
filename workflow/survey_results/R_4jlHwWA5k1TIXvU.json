    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI allows me to imput the rubric and my assignment and ask it to give me feedback on whether I have completed the assignment to the rubric correctly and if I am missing anything. It is nice to get some form of feedback before submitting an assignment so that you can improve. All feedback from teachers is retrospect, the assignment has already been marked and you can't use it as easily and promptly",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI feedback doesn't make me feel a particular way as I'm going for advice before an assignment is submitted. It hasn't been graded yet and I can still make changes.\nFeedback from a teacher can be a hard pill to swallow sometimes. Especially if you have tried hard on the assignment and it didn't go as you thought it would. This is I guess because the assignment is already graded and there's nothing more you can do about it",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback is as detailed or as succinct as you ask it to be. You can just keep asking it questions about your writing to make sure you've hit all the points. Even about the structure of you assignment.\nFeedback from the teachers is limited and to get more you need to set up a time with your tutor etc which isn't as instantaneous or accessible",
