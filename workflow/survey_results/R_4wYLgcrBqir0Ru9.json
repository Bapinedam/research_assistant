    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The only difference is that I take on board what the teacher says 100% of the time, because my grade is dependent on it. Even if I don't always agree with the subjective nature of human feedback! I can ignore Chat GPT if I think I know better.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI I can ignore, and I have no emotion attached to the feedback. It is purely objective. The teacher's feedback, although I listen to it more, is more subjective, and I pay less attention to it because of all the conflicting feedback I get from different teachers.",

    "Response": "Teacher's feedback is too subjective, I find it differs from project to project. Eg: Teacher X: This graph looks good, I like this approach! Teacher Y: This graph is over complicated, use this. Why are you grouping numbers into arbitrary categories?",
