    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "As I said above, as a curious person, AI has helped me answer a lot of knowledge questions so that I can think of more ideas for assessment. Of course, teachers can answer these questions, but they will not have enough time to help a student answer dozens of questions. Therefore, AI will be a great help in this case.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from teachers will of course be more relevant to the topic of the lesson, and of course will help students get higher grades. However, AI is also a good choice because artificial intelligence is now at a high level in terms of knowledge, and is getting better every day.",
