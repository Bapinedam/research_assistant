    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is more useful for me in the drafting phases, when I'm trying to make sense of my own thoughts on a topic. I was able to use UTS's AI program to give me feedback on my reflective work and this had some useful tips. The teacher is generally more useful after it's submitted, and when you're thinking about your next assessment. Usually you don't get much teacher feedback until it's \"too late\" to fix your assessment.",
