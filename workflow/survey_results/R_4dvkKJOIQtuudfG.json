    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Sometimes the teacher can't answer my questions immediately, if it's after class or during holidays. Sometimes as an international student, you will encounter some language problems. Sometimes these problems are not serious enough to ask the school for help, but you feel that it would be too intrusive to ask the teacher just because of this problem.",
