    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is bound to offer a more detailed feedback with clear details on what it believed was good or bad. However, due to the lack of human element, GenAI is simply estimating what is considered good and bad, it does not have the experience or the knowledge your teachers likely have. Plus, your teacher can offer unique insights like how to make sure your work has a clear message, point of view, as well as ensuring that it meets the teacher’s criteria.",
