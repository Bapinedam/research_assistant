    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "It isn't very helpful in my field of study (mathematics/physics). It is often wrong and unable to understand the task. My assessment is rarely a written task where generative AI is the most useful. GenAI struggles to communicate mathematics but is very rarely useful in giving steps on how to solve a given problem.",
