    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI always makes mistakes because it does not alalways follow the rubrics, while teachers can detect the specific mistakes on the assignment and help us to fix it. However, using AI is very time-efficient and does not requires in-person support, while teachers always need to spend more time on the tutoring process.",
