    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Often times in class I have asked my teacher for feedback and they have told me my work is well done, deserving of full marks but only to give me 75/100 or 60/100 etc in the actual grade, GenAI might not find all issues with the work that I am submitting but I expect it to not, It is useful for basic issues but not much further",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My Teachers' feedback made me feel incredibly frustrated as approx 75% of my teachers do not give adequate feedback GenAI is more structured and easy to understand what I am doing wrong, As I am proficient with AI prompts if I dont understand something I know exactly what to ask to get the answer I desire.",
