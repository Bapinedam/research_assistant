  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI improves self-directed learning by promoting research and idea development, yet it may lack specificity for individual assignment requirements. On the other hand, feedback provided by a university instructor is more specific and personalized to your studies, resulting in a more profound comprehension and focused enhancements.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback comes across as indifferent and detached, concentrating solely on tasks without any emotional engagement. On the other hand, feedback given by a university professor is individualized and uplifting, providing motivation and support that boosts your confidence and sense of worth.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback provides a rapid and wide range of information, yet it does not offer the detailed analysis and personalized guidance found in feedback from a teacher. Teachers offer personalized guidance regularly, encourage conversations, and provide emotional assistance, while GenAI is more detached and focused on completing specific tasks.",
