    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is just always available to help, whereas a teacher does not work 24/7. You can also get GenAI to answer your questions in multiple ways until you find a way that you understand. However, with a teacher you usually have limited time and don't want to take up too much of their time so often don't get your questions answered in a way that you understand.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes, a teacher is a person so they can make you feel badly about the feedback they give you. Whereas with GenAI I know that it's not a person so I don't attach human feelings to it.",
