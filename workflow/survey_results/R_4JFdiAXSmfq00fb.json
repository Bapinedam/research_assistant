    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I wanted to make sure that my critical thinking, creativity, and problem-solving abilities were completely applied to the task, thus I avoided from using GenAI to provide feedback on my work. If I only used AI, I might not be able to gain these necessary abilities and might become overly dependent on technology.",
