    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I only use it to get feedback on my recreational writing, not academic writing. This is because I believe that professors and peers are better at providing personalised and specific feedback, that reflects the requirements of the assessment. I believe that GenAI can often be unreliable at providing feedback for things such as university assignments and projects.",
