    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I wouldn't say it made a different, but I think knowing that GenAI was always available in terms of grabbing advice in comparison to my teacher was nice, however, I always questioned whether the feedback was \"genuine\" or it was actually sufficient in terms of assisting me with my learning.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "In terms of GenAI, I sometimes felt it didn't even help as much, or helped me less, as sometimes GenAI will have a differing opinion compared to my teachers. In saying that as well, GenAI takes a completely objective stance (or tries to) dependent on other people's searches, where as the teacher goes off their experience and what they've seen from other students.",
