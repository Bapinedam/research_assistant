    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI has been very helpful for certain aspects of my learning, particularly for brainstorming ideas and providing an initial understanding of new topics. It's also useful for scanning and correcting typos or identifying issues that might not align with grading criteria. However, when it comes to deeper, contextual explanations, teachers are far more effective. Teachers understand the specific objectives of our courses and can tailor their explanations to align with our learning goals, ensuring that we grasp the material in a way that fits within the broader framework of our university education.",
