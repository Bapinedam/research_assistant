    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "An example I like to use is when I was struggling with some code and the error came down to me misreading the letter \"l\" and the number \"1\". This was an error that none of my peers or lab tutors were able to pick up when I asked for assistance. However, when I asked ChatGPT to explain the code to me I was able to pinpoint the error and fix it. \nI also personally struggle greatly with writing non-report style assignments. I find that GenAI is often able to help me work out a method for writing and structuring that is able to assist me in starting my assignments.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It feels less judgemental as I know there is not another person critiquing my work- there is nothing personal about the comparison when AI completes it. It also feels less biased, depending on who the teacher evaluating my work is.",
