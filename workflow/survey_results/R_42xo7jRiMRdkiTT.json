    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAl's feedback answers questions quickly and provides multiple perspectives. This is particularly useful for gaining a quick understanding of a topic. However, GenAl's feedback can be generic and lacks personalisation for specific learning objectives or contexts.\nTeachers can provide specific suggestions for improvement and additional support in the assessment of complex concepts or projects.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI's feedback is more immediate and structured than that of a teacher, and is more efficient, but lacks personalisation and emotional resonance compared to a teacher. Teacher feedback is usually more personalised and emotionally warm, providing more of a sense of support and interaction",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI's feedback takes less account of context and individual differences and relies more on pre-existing data. Teacher feedback is more contextualised, long-term and practical",
