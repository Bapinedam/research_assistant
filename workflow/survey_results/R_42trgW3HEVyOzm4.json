    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI was able to help with providing more information as to why it might believe that my assignment was good/bad based on the rubricks I provided it, and how to work on it.\nThe lecturers and tutors are more likely to not assist with providing any form of feedback other than at the end of the assignment when the results come out, as \"if I do it for you, I have to do it for everyone else and that's not fair|\"",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is at least able to provide some form of feedback that could be useful to help improve my work, lecturers and tutors are more than likely not at all helpful as their hands are tied and may be worried about favouring one student over another or having to help all other students in their work.",
