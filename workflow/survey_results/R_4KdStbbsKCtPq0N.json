    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Since the feedback given by the tutors are generic, it gets hard for me to see which parts require the change, compared to how AI gives me feedback, it highlights all the places I need to change, and also suggests how I should change it, and why it should be changed.",
