    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Sometimes the teacher's feedback conflicts with what I believe the instructions were or the content, which can be frustrating. Whereas you already know that AI is going to get things incorrect and isn't really able to understand what is important.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI can go more broad with knowledge which is often not supportive of the learning at hand, but really can put things into a broader context.  The teacher is often giving feedback in class to help those who haven't put the work in or read the material.",
