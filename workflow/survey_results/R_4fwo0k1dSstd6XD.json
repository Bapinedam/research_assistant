    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Comparing GenAI and my teacher, I've found that GenAI provides clearer instructions, guidance, and descriptions than my teacher. Additionally, GenAI allows me to generate examples for various cases, which makes it much easier for me to understand the content of the lecture. This ability to instantly access tailored examples enhances my learning experience by offering practical insights that complement the theoretical concepts taught by my teacher.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When comparing feedback from GenAI and my teacher, I noticed that AI feedback is mostly consistent, while the feedback from my teacher can be inconsistent, especially since they have many lectures to manage. For example, I once received feedback on an assignment telling me to do something specific. When I followed that advice, the next round of feedback suggested I should have approached it differently, which left me confused about which feedback to follow.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Additionally, feedback from my teacher, particularly in design, often feels subjective and influenced by personal opinion, whereas GenAI provides feedback that feels more professional and objective.",
