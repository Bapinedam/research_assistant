    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI usually gives more detailed feedback and sometimes provides steps to follow to improve the piece of writing (Research Report, etc). A teacher might not give a very detailed/helpful feedback and sometimes it might only be saying that something is wrong without giving an explanation.",
