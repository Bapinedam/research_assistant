    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I am hesitant to put my intellectual property into GenAI and have it take it or appropriate it without my permission. I do not want university plagiarism checkers to think that I plagiarised or used GenAI to create an assignment just because the tool appropriates my own intellectual property. \n\nI do not trust its ability to find accurate sources, to be not biased, to be completely reliable.",
