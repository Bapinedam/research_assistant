    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "For example, in the translation assignment, as there is no completely correct answer, the translation suggestions and examples given by the teacher are very reference-oriented, taking into account the context, readers and cultural background. Even if AI makes the above requirements, it will be difficult for the translation it provides to meet these requirements.",
