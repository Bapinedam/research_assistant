    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "One reason for not using GenAI for feedback could be a preference for human feedback, which often includes more nuanced and context-aware insights. Human reviewers can understand the subtleties of creativity and intention that AI might miss. Additionally, feedback from colleagues or experts in a field might offer more tailored and practical advice based on their experience and understanding of the subject matter.",
