    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I do not rely heavily on it at all so I wouldn’t say that it has impacted my learning positively or negatively, I also find that it says contradictory information and I don’t trust it. Definitely a teacher is an invaluable resource though.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I guess the biggest difference is that you can continue to tweak your work and get as much feedback as you like from AI, alternatively you get the teacher feedback once your work is submitted and its too late to improve the assignment you have received the feedback on. Obviously this is not the point though, it is feedback for future work.",
