    "Response": "The feedback we get from lecturers is typically post-submission, and therefore is not helpful in the sense that we cannot action the feedback and improve the assessment prior to final submission. Also, lots of the feedback we get from lecturers is subjective and general. When using GenAI, I get specific, arguably objective feedback, and can action these suggestions prior to submission, thus helping me identify and fill the gaps or weaknesses in my writing.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Getting feedback from lecturers/ markers is tough, as you cannot action it or change the assessment piece once you are made aware of the weaknesses in your writing. However, with GenAI, it feels almost empowering, as I can identify the areas I need to improve prior to submission, and once actioned, feel more confident in the piece that is submitted.",
