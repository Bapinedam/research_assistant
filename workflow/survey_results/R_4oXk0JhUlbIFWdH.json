    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Less awkward to ask for help, judgement from teachers being like 'you should have known this content', feels more empowered to come to my own conclusions to an answer when using AI as it doesn't provide you the precise answer but helps provide a starting point on how to answer the question. If AI was really that precise, everyone would have HDs by now.",
