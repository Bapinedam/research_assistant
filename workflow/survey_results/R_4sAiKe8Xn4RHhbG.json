    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I didn't know this was an option. I prefer to proof read my own work as it is my words I'm using and the concepts I'm writing about I write in the way I understand the best. if I want feedback, I will ask another student who has studied my course to read through my writing to see if it makes sense.",
