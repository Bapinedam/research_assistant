    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I think the standard of evaluation between humans and GenAI is different, GenAI did produce or generate something, but it can't give feedback or judgment based on human standards. So I prefer to get feedback from a real person.",
