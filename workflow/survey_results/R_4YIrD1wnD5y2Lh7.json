    "Response": "From a teacher I know that I am receiving reliable information that I can use in my assignment to elevate my work, whereas GenAI can be less accurate and most of the time produces a different way of writing my assignments rather than adding to enhance it.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "From a teacher, I can get feedback that will help my work but it can be less accessible, especially in busy assignments times where there is a large class and less time to ask for help. Whereas GenAI can provide fast feedback from typing in the search bar, this is normally less rushed than feedback from a teacher.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "From a teacher is a credible source that can directly assist, GenAI uses the same responses in most cases based of key words which can get misunderstood and not represent the criteria of the assessment.",
