    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is helpful in narrowing down information that is useful. For example, there is less risk that GenAI will misunderstand my question, or not address the question directly. However, feedback from the teacher tends to be more relevant and helpful in carrying out specific assignment requirements.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When GenAI is unhelpful, its easy to adjust my wording to work towards a helpful answer. When a teacher gives unhelpful feedback, it can be quite difficult to try follow that up to get helpful feedback. In that way, poor teacher feedback can be stressful, where GenAI is usually not so.",
