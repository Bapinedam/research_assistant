    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It depends on the teacher, but generally GenAI is less useful for feedback or very specific questions about your work. I believe the way it filters through information is somewhat incomplete, so doubts that a teacher could answer in seconds, and accurately, GenAI has a bit more trouble.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "No differences, although I believe GenAI is very complacent, and may change its answers if you insist (may give wrong answers if you insist enough).",

    "Response": "Tasks relating to critical thinking and analyzing can cause trouble to GenAI, and you may risk a bad feedback if enquiring about those.",
