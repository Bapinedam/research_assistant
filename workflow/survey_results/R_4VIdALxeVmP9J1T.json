    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback is a lot more direct because I am getting it to mark my work against the rubric therefore it is very straightforward. This means I can directly change writing before I submit an assignment which the GenAI thinks is unclear etc. \nteacher feedback always comes after submission unless there is an essay plan assignment. Otherwise it requires booking an appointment with a teacher to get feedback before the due date. In this case I would rather skip the hassle of organising a meeting with a teacher if I can get pretty good feedback from GenAI",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from a teacher sometimes feels biased. I often feel like I have to or have had to write about certain topics depending on who was marking my work. There have been some assessments where I felt the teacher's feedback on an essay (subjective) had been an objective assessment of my work based on their views on the topic. \nGenAI is not biased however I feel like it does generate similar answers regardless of the work. Sometimes making me feel like its not actually reading my work and just giving me a 70-80. However, I find this problem is overcome if I ask for more specific advice about what parts of my essay do not align with the HD bracket of the criteria.",
