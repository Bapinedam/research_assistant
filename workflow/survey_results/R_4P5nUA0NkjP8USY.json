    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I found while GenAI could provide some general feedback, often it didn't align with the specific teachings of the course (e.g. the details of certain theories or processes we were expected to follow) and so I typically did not take that feedback on. Feedback from teachers has always been in line with the expectations and teachings of the course, so I've found this is easier to apply.",
