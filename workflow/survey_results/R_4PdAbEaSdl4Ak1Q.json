    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I do sometimes feel quite stupid when getting the same feedback from teachers, like I'm not trying or listening to what they are saying. When in fact I am. I don't feel this way with the GenAI as I know it's not someone and not able to judge or form opinions.",
