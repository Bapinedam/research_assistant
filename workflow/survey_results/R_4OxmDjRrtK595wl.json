    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Most units are strict about the use of AI in assignments, and I am a bit unsure where the line is for most units, so I just don't do it.\nIn saying that, I feel quite confident in my academic abilities, and if I were to need feedback I know I could just ask my lecturer (or writing mentors, etc.)",
