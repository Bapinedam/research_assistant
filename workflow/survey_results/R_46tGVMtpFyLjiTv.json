    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI is more readily available to check my work and provide feedback whereas University teachers are often not allowed to in-depth check my writing. AI made it easier because in high school we had teachers who were able to check writing all the time.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI feedback is much less helpful than the insightful feedback of teachers. AI usually only helps with grammar and organising of sentences whereas teachers help with the actual ideas and substance of my writing.",
