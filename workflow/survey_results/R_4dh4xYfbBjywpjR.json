  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Sometimes I’m conflicted trusting the AI as it doesn’t really have all the context necessary to provide feedback. One of the key differences is that I need to provide a lot of context when asking for the feedback. Whereas with a teacher they have all the information needed to help with feedback",
