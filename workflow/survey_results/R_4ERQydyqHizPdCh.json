    "Question": "Why didn’t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because of its accuracy, it’s better to check the work myself rather than use GenAI. It’s only good for generating, not checking as I did it sometimes and GenAI is terrible for checking. It always imitates my answers. For example, when you asks GenAI 1 + 1 = 3, it initally said wrong, but when you insist on that it is true, AI will follow that and say it’s true",
