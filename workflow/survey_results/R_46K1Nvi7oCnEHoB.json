    "Response": "The both can help me improve my skills on writing. but AI is helpful as i can ask questions at any time but i have to wait for teacher's feedback, and before the final submission, teacher will not give detail feedback to you, they most wanna you bring critical thinking about the questions. It was helpful but sometimes im not sure if i was on the right track or not.",
