    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I mostly ask questions about the structure and flow of a piece of writing. GenAI is pretty good at this and can give constructive feedback if you give firm criteria or the rubric you are working with. The teacher's feedback is always going to be the most trustworthy as they are marking the work.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Not really. I guess it could feel more personal from a teacher. But honestly, right now, I think that any feedback is important and should be considered and critiqued.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI is usually targeted and structured ways to improve the piece of writing. Pointing out sections for improvement. Teachers can shy away from this level of detail as they tend to consider it doing the work for you.",
