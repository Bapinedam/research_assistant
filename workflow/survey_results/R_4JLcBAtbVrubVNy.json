    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It has helped me write more coherently and with a good sense of flow, sometimes. Obviously AI has nothing on a teacher but for the written flow it's good.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I think using AI is interesting because you can spend as much time as you like working on things and there is less vulnerability there because you don't have to interact with another person about it.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Gen AI is too general quite often and can't provide specific approaches to specific problems very well like a teacher can. I think it has some merit for general assessments of whether a piece of writing is answering an essay question or criteria.",
