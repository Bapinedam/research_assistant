    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "GenAI provides surface level/textbook critiques and feedback and often makes mistakes. It is fine to use to make sure you haven't missed any major parts of a topic, but when I put a piece of writing in it and ask for advice, its feedback is extremely limited and lackluster. Often it offers a re-wording that is more convoluted and distorts the actual meaning of the text. Grammerly is much more proficient at providing useful feedback on grammar and sentence structure.",
