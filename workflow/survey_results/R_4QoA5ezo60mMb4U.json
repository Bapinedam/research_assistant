    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When considering the helpfulness of feedback from GenAI versus a university teacher, both have distinct advantages. GenAI can be incredibly helpful for quick, automated feedback on specific queries, providing instant responses that can clarify doubts or reinforce understanding in real-time. However, a university teacher's feedback is often more tailored and nuanced, drawing from their experience and understanding of the student’s progress and learning style. This personalized approach can be more beneficial for complex or subjective assessments that require deep understanding and contextual insight.\n\nIn terms of trustworthiness, feedback from a university teacher is generally seen as more reliable because it comes from an expert familiar with the subject matter, assessment criteria, and individual student needs. While GenAI provides accurate information based on large datasets, it may not always consider the specific context or nuances of a particular course or assignment, which can affect its reliability.\n\nThe impact on learning differs significantly between the two. Feedback from a university teacher often encourages deeper thinking and reflection, fostering a more interactive learning process where students can ask follow-up questions and engage in discussions. This human element can be crucial for motivation and understanding. On the other hand, GenAI feedback can promote independent learning and exploration by offering immediate assistance and a broad range of resources, making it an excellent tool for quick learning and revision. Ultimately, combining both sources of feedback could provide the most comprehensive learning experience, balancing immediacy and depth.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The feedback from GenAI and a university teacher can evoke different feelings due to the nature of their responses. Feedback from GenAI often feels neutral and objective, which can be helpful when looking for straightforward answers or clarification without any emotional weight. This type of feedback can make you feel more independent and empowered to learn on your own terms. However, it might lack the personal touch that can make feedback feel more engaging and encouraging.\n\nIn contrast, feedback from a university teacher tends to feel more personal and supportive. A teacher can acknowledge your efforts, provide encouragement, and offer constructive criticism in a way that feels more relatable and empathetic. This kind of feedback can be motivating, as it often includes specific praise or suggestions tailored to your unique learning style and needs. It can also make you feel more connected and understood, which is important for building confidence and a deeper engagement with the subject matter.\n\nOverall, while GenAI feedback can be quick and efficient, it may not provide the same emotional reassurance or encouragement that a teacher's feedback can offer. The personal interaction with a teacher can make the learning experience feel more human and supportive, which can be especially important for motivation and long-term learning.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "The feedback from GenAI and a university teacher differs in several key ways. Feedback from a university teacher is often more in-depth and specific, drawing on a nuanced understanding of the student's previous work, learning style, and personal context. Teachers can provide detailed explanations and tailored advice, which GenAI might lack due to its generalized nature. A teacher also considers the broader context of a student’s progress, offering a holistic approach that supports the student's overall development, whereas GenAI gives feedback based solely on the input it receives at the moment. Additionally, feedback from a teacher often comes with the opportunity for further dialogue, allowing students to ask follow-up questions and engage in deeper discussions. This can lead to a more interactive and meaningful learning experience. Teachers also offer emotional support and encouragement, creating a supportive learning environment that GenAI, with its purely informational feedback, does not provide. Finally, teachers can adapt their feedback to suit different learning styles, offering various methods to help students understand, while GenAI usually provides feedback in a standard format. These differences mean that while GenAI can offer quick and efficient feedback, a university teacher provides a more personalized, context-rich, and emotionally supportive experience that can greatly enhance learning and engagement.",
