    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I could prod and pry the ai to get exactly the information i wanted on how to improve say a paragraph instantly, whereas with a teacher they are split between thirty students and don't have that kind of time.\nTeachers often understand what you're after faster, and they cater their answers to how the unit is actually taught, where as GenAI can often answer with different notation than what you're supposed to know or use.",
