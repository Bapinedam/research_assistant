    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "At this stage of AI development, I don't trust its guidance on my work. GenAI produces inhuman, very formulaic writing that I personally do not think is beneficial. \nAdditionally, I have heard of some AI tools holding data to learn from and I do not want my academic work to be held.",
