    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "teachers tend to provide long winded and difficult to understand feedback, usually failing to get to the point and provide a clear explanation in terms of feedback, whereas with AI you are able to ask it questions about the feedback in a more direct way which makes me feel less frustrated as i am able to understand more easily for example, \"why I got something wrong\"",
