    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI provides one certain view or more robust suggestions, whereas teacher feedback can be very various from teacher to teacher, making the formation of work and what teachers look for in work more confusing.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI would give clear but sometimes limited suggestions, although the feedback is more set in stone. However, teacher feedback may be more encouraging or discouraging depending on their feedback style (like did they just criticise where I needed to do work or did they add what parts I did well in).",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI can give immediate feedback prior to submitting, whereas teachers will only mark your work and give feedback once the work is submitted majority of the time. Therefore there is limited time and effort to improve my work prior to submitting.",
