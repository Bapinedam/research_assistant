    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "In fact, AI's assistance in learning is not as helpful as a teacher's, because AI's approach can sometimes be wrong. For example, when calculating NPV, if I ask AI, it might give me a complex formula and then provide the wrong answer. However, if I ask a teacher, they will show me how to use Excel, which is clearly more convenient, efficient, and accurate.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "With AI, I can ask questions at any time, but the responses are not always good. A teacher, on the other hand, can only be asked during working hours, but the answers are much better.",
