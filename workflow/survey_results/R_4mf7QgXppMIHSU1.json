    "Response": "GenAI feedback is very broad, a usually non-specific unless prompted so. Teacher feedback (for the most part) tends to carry more meaning and value to me, because they have had formal training in my discipline.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback can sometimes be more emotional, because I feel that had a choice in choosing their words. Feedback from GenAI, I couldn't care about, because to my knowledge it is not conscious and just spits out words which most fit the algorithm.",
