    "Response": "GenAI is more a consistent reminder of mistakes I make while writing, teacher feedback is only available after submission and it's rare to notice the difference between assignments.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI, since it's not a person, has no emotional reaction for me. Teacher feedback is more negatively received as I have to speak and see the person who reviewed work of mine that may not be up to their standard.",
