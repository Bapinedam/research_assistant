    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI's feedback was more spelling and grammar based. It didn't really try to correct my description of concepts and if it did I ignored it. Teacher feedback enabled me to learn more from the assignment and carry it over into other assessments.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback (on an assignment) can sometimes be shorter (they have other papers to mark) but zoom in on the relevant parts of the assignment where I lost marks, AI feedback gives more general and broad insight.",
