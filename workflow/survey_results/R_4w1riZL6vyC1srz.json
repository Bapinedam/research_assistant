    "Response": "The feedback from GenAI has been statiscally been predicted to tell me what i want to hear without me telling it to explain to me the explicit and intricate details of what i would like it to elucidate whereas my lecturer could give me a much more concise and relevant answer in a heartbeat. Students like me use chatGPT very different to what other people in a different degree would such as (arts, philosophy, doctor etc.. (just wanted to point that out).",
