    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback is often based on personal opinions and might not always agree with what AI suggests. I use AI to cover the basics, but I know teachers provide valuable insights beyond that, which is why theyâ€™re important.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "The main difference is the context in which a teacher provides feedback and what they expect to receive from the student on the assignment. I believe AI doesn't fully grasp these nuances, which is why you can't rely 100% on its feedback.",
