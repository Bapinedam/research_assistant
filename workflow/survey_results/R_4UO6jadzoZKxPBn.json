    "Question": "Why didn’t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I don't trust that it will accurately assess the work, or that it will actually understand what I've written in maths assignments — when I've typed an assignment, maybe it would work, but it wouldn't make sense to me to type up a handwritten assignment just to have AI look at it, especially when I've found it does very poorly at following logical reasoning.",
