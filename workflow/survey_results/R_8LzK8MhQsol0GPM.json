    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Using GenAI gives me quick help organising my thoughts and finding information, which makes tasks easier. But my teachers offered personal guidance, explained things clearly, and adapted to my learning style. GenAI is great for efficiency, while teachers helped me truly understand and learn concepts more deeply.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes, there’s a difference. Feedback from GenAI is quick and helpful, but it feels impersonal. It’s great for instant support, but it doesn’t give the same sense of encouragement or understanding. Feedback from my teachers, on the other hand, felt more thoughtful and supportive. They could recognise my progress and challenges, making the feedback feel more meaningful and motivating.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI gives quick, neutral feedback, while teachers offer more personalised, in-depth responses. Teachers' feedback feels more supportive and focuses on long-term improvement, whereas GenAI is more about immediate fixes without much context.",
