    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is great for quick fixes and technical suggestions, but my teacher’s feedback is usually more meaningful and specific to what I need to work on. My teacher’s input helps me understand things on a deeper level, while GenAI is better for making quick improvements on the spot",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When I get feedback from my teacher, it feels more personal and motivating, which makes me feel more confident in what I’m learning. GenAI feedback is useful, but it can feel a bit impersonal, so it doesn’t always give me the same boost.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "One key difference is that GenAI feedback is more automated and often lacks context about my broader goals or challenges, while my teacher understands the bigger picture and provides feedback that aligns with my overall learning journey. My teacher can also pick up on subtle issues that GenAI might miss, especially when it comes to more complex or subjective tasks.",
