    "Response": "GenAI is an easier and on the spot option whereas getting feedback from your teacher may take a few days - if you are in a crunch, it is a lot easier to use AI although less accurate and relevant.",

    "Response": "Neither feedback has made me feel any way, I usually take feedback as constructive criticism rather than something to have an emotional response to.\nFeedback from teachers does aid in making me feel like I do or do not understand the general content however.",
