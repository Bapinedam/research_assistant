    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI can check everything and give me detailed written feedback everytime. this is not feasible or expected for my teacher to do, they're feedback is normally verbal. Gen AI, however cannot process it like a human would and doesn't know exactly how the markers will mark the work, but a teacher generally will",
