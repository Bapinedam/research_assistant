    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The AI can be creative, provide a specific solution or bring something novel or from other aspect to your attention. However, it is not always correct, and it can easily confuse you. It is better to have a basic knowledge of something and then ask AI. \nOn the other hand, your teacher is almost correct, and you can completely trust him.",
