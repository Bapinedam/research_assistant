    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",

I still resort to old school methods (reading books, papers, related supplemental resources etc.), which may sound boring to many but I do enjoy it.  \nI resort to these \"old school methods\" for feed back than just going to GenAI to validate my work.\nAlso, I don't trust it!",
