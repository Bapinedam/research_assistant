    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is often wrong when it comes to literature and spellchecking, as well as cutting out words to hit word count. I believe it can be used as a wrong idea of improvement, but teacher feedback is often tailored to the assignment and is what you will be marked on. i much easier take on feedback from teachers as i trust them.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I feel as if Teacher feedback feels personal, where AI typically feels as if it hasnt read the prompt and understood it, instead provide general and blanket statements.",
