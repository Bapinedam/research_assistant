  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI is a better marker - while teachers try their best to remain unbiased and mark according to the rubric, they are only human; AI is not - it marks strictly based on the rubric, and there is no chance of bias between assignment's (ie AI can't get a headache from marking 20 assignments in a row).",
