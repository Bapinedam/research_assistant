  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI feels very generic, often it gives overly wordy responses which aren't useful in actually improving your work, feedback from teachers (when time has been put into the feedback) is almost always better. In the case that the teacher hasn't put much time into the feedback which is quite common, AI can give more valuable feedback. It depends on the teacher really",
