  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedbacks are mostly general feedbacks whereas teachers provide an indepth feedback of where to improve and what can be done to make the work or learning process better. GenAI feedbacks are generally untrustworthy since the feedbacks varies from time to time",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers' feedback often made me feel optimistic and assisted me in working to make my assignments better. however considering GenAI, the feedback often left me in a state of confusion cause the feedback was quite general or wasn't relevant for the work",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI often shared information that was shared to it previously as feedbacks and asking feedbacks repeatedly would likely bring up similar feedbacks rather than new elaborate feedbacks , which teachers often provide students with.",
