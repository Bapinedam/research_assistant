    "Response": "Tutors feedback is more connected to the actual ideas in the essay and they have good ideas to enhance the essay but at the same time they don't necessarily how. \neg. \"this sentence could expand on this idea...\"\nGenAI sometimes finishes the sentence or edits it, but focuses more on the literacy and grammar side of things",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "They're both good forms of feedback, but a tutor who has studied the material and been the person teaching the tutorials, is more reliable. Though, sometimes their feedback seems ridiculous. GenAI is more straight forward and focuses more on the written component rather than the ideas shared.",
