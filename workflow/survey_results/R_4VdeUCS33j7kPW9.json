    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Some abstract knowledge using AI to study will be more easier b/c instead of formula or some concept knowldge, AI will found some pratical example associated with that information helping me to understand it, and also some detailed knowledge that didnt queit understand during the class, can be explained by AI quickly, which save the time that sending the email to professor.\nOn the other side, professor answering about some complicated question will be more trustworthy.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Just for me, it will be more easier for me to ask AI when some simple/stupid question raise, AI is a tool to ask instead of person, and you would not worry about this knowledge you should know before the class and you still not know about it.",
