    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Using GenAI to receive feedback has always been a preliminary tool, mainly for use to gain a sense of where my work has been strongest and weakest. The difference from gaining feedback directly from the teacher is that the feedback highlights the most important, real-world strengths and weaknesses of my work.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes. I personally take GenAI feedback very apathetically, in that it doesn't make me feel a certain way. Whereas with feedback from my teacher there is an emotional connection to it, and can make me feel happy/sad when I receive it.",
