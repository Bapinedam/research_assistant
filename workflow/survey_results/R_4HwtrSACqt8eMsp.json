    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers often don't have the time and resources to give helpful detailed feedback, GenAI can provide more feedback on word choice (like a thesaurus) and writing style as well as give ideas of areas missed. Teachers often only give a very small one-three sentences of feedback about a whole essay, making it hard to improve",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from the teachers often feels impersonal - often the same feedback is copy and pasted between students and changed very slightly. it isn't overly helpful to improving writing for future assignments.",
