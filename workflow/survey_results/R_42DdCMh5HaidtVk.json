    "Question": "Why didn’t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I only use GenAI to give me ideas and run tasks that are time consuming like reading long text and researching the internet to point me to the right direction I need to go with my assessments. I didn’t find it necessary to get feedback from my work, I get that from the university help or tutors.",
