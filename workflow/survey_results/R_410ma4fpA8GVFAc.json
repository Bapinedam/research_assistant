  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I will continue to use IELTS writing as an example. In terms of writing structure, teachers have better writing templates for getting high scores, but AI's correction of essays seems to be that as long as the grammar is correct and the general content is described, it will give a high score.",
