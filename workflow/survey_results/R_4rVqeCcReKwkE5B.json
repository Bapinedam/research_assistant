    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The feedback from GenAI was useful for quick revisions and immediate responses, helping me to identify and correct surface-level errors or improve the flow of my writing. However, since the feedback was more generic, it didn't always address deeper aspects, such as theoretical understanding or the broader implications of my arguments. In contrast, feedback from my university teacher had a more significant impact on my learning, as it was detailed and focused on developing my critical thinking and analytical skills. My teacher's feedback helped me better understand complex concepts and apply them in various contexts, leading to a deeper and more comprehensive learning experience.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes, there were noticeable differences in how the feedback made me feel. Feedback from GenAI often made me feel more independent and confident in making quick improvements, as it was immediate and accessible. However, it sometimes felt impersonal and left me unsure about the depth of my understanding. On the other hand, feedback from my university teacher made me feel more supported and validated, as it was personalized and based on their deep understanding of my work. This human connection provided reassurance and motivated me to engage more deeply with the material.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "There were several other differences between the feedback I received from GenAI and my teacher. GenAI's feedback was typically more focused on technical aspects, such as grammar, sentence structure, and surface-level clarity, and was delivered instantly. It was also consistent and available anytime, which made it a convenient tool for quick revisions. However, it lacked the nuanced understanding of context, intentions, and the broader goals of my assignments that my teacher provided.\n\nIn contrast, my teacher’s feedback was more holistic and tailored to my individual learning progress. It often included insights into how my work related to the course objectives, suggestions for deeper analysis, and advice on improving my critical thinking skills. My teacher could also engage in a dialogue with me, allowing for clarifications and further guidance, which fostered a more interactive and enriching learning experience. Additionally, my teacher’s feedback often incorporated encouragement and constructive criticism, which helped build my confidence and motivation to improve.",
