    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI allows feedback at anytime for anything which can make it useful, however it is certainly not the most reliable and feedback from a teacher is often much more trustworthy. One problem with feedback from teachers is that they have to look at so many assignments in a short period of time so the feedback is often general or not very in-depth.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from Teachers often feels less good because it is often very general and not in-depth so it can feel like they haven't really engaged with what was written or that they haven't had the time to properly give constructive criticism. In contrast, genAI often is more specific makes it feel personal which is nice, however the quality of the feedback is often questionable.",
