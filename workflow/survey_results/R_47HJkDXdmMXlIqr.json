    "Response": "every piece of feedback gen ai gave me had to be taken with a grain of salt, as it does not understand the context in which my work was written, whereas i could know that my teacher knew what they were talking about & were concerned about me doing well in the class. however, teachers are less available to provide feedback especially before i hand an assignment in.",
