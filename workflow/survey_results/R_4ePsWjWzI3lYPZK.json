    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "In my opinion, it is better not to, because ai analyzes and creates on the basis of the data provided, and does not give too much innovation to some unique ideas. In addition, college students have their own national identity, and ai will give the answers they want from a more peaceful perspective, and more critical thinking will be more comprehensive",
