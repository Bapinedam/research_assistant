    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I don't really trust AI feedback very often. But sometimes it will come up with something that I did not think of. However AI feedback is given to you instantaneously. You have to wait for teacher feedback for sooooo long. By the point you get it back, you have already finished your next assignment. However I will always for the most part take teacher feedback on board because it is from a real person with proper credentials!",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I take teacher feedback a little more personally. As in it will contribute to my self worth a lot more. AI feedback does not mean much to me. Mostly, I use it as a last resort for brainstorming gaps in a topic that I may have missed, rather than actually feedback to take on board.",
