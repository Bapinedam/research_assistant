    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI tend to suggest general feedback and sometimes even misleading. We really have to understand the matter that we are asking about to AI. However, it is very good to provide initial understanding and comparative thinking. Meanwhile, the feedback from my teachers are really significant and concerned to the matter that I require for my study.",
