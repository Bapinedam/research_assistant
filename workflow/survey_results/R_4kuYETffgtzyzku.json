    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I feel like AI can be a bit more in depth than teachers and give an unbiased outlook at things like essay writing that teachers cannot achieve. But they are also not as trustworthy as teachers in terms of feedback as I don't feel like I can fully believe that they are using the correct resources to assess my writing/project. And at times definitively correct answers has been said as incorrect by AI which makes it hard to trust.",
