    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Usually feedback from a teacher is far more applicable and actionable, as the teacher is the person who is grading your assignments and guiding your learning, whereas AI is just giving you more objective feedback based on what it thinks you want to hear.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback can sometimes make me feel more anxious, because I don't want to come across as if I'm not understanding the content or assignments. In comparison, AI is far less emotional of an experience because it is not a human.",
