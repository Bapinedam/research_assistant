    "Response": "My primary way of learning is from the teacher, I only use AI as a secondary help (usually as last resort). Overall, I'll say AI does have some significant impact on my understanding of a concept on a few occassions.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher's feedback tends to feel more critical and harsh with vague comments on how to improve. On the other hand, AI tends to use more supporting language and feels more polite on how it provides feedback.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teacher's feedbacks are often a hit or miss, with some being really specific on the mistakes you've made and how to improve on them whilst some are just vague. However, AI feels more general in its feedback and does provide a decent explanation on how to fix your mistakes but it often just does it for you.",
