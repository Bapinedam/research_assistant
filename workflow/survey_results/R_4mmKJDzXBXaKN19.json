    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It's much easier to go to GenAI for simple feedback things (ie spelling and grammar checking, cohesiveness of writing), thats what I use it for, whereas obviously I'd never go to a teacher asking for that kind of help. However, if i needed more indepth or specific feedback on an assignment I obviously would reach out to the teacher not GenAI. \nBoth fulfill two distinct niches in my eyes.",
