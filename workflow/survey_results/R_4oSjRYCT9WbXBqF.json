    "Response": "Feedback from a teacher can feel repetitive and reused (at no fault of their own, they are not paid enough to mark more than they need to. AI can help give more targeted feedback in certain areas.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I do sometimes feel like teacher feedback is a bit cold, simply for the rinse and repeat marking they have to do. AI feedback makes me feel nothing, only that humanity is edging closer to its end.",
