  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from AI made me sceptical and frustrated in a sense that I am not always sure if the model understands what I mean because it does not have contextual understanding. Feedback from the teacher made me feel more relaxed and in control of my improvement",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from Gen AI is definitely good when working on the prototypes of your assessment to get a different perspective of how you could approach the scenarios. But the feedback from the teacher is holistic in some manner and has subjective elements that help in improving further",
