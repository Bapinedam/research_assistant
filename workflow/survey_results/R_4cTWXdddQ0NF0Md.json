    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Well at the end of the day, the teacher is the one marking the assignments, not AI. So the teacher feedback was more useful because they're the ones marking it. The teacher feedback tends to be a lot more focused on certain niches taught within the course whereas AI takes a more hollistic approach as it draws from knowledge outside of the class.",
