    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I find utilising AI can be helpful when it comes to generating initial ideas and linking ne/unfamiliar concepts. The big difference related to convenience and timing, as while in class I can speak to a tutor, however while studying I find instant feedback and support more time effective. I prefer not to email tutors unless it's and urgent and/or important question that only they can answer. However, AI is useful for the smaller things that are not necessarily urgent but helpful.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Receiving feedback from a person is always more valuable and significant in contrast to a tool. While AI is helpful, it does not replace the expertise of a university lecturer. Personalised feedback makes me feel supported and accountable. It enables me to build on what I have started. AI is unable to provide this level of support, feedback and confirmation that I am meeting the unit requirements'. Also, AI has the advantage of time. It can provide more information, and in detail. Tutors do not have this time available.",
