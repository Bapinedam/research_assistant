    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because using chatbot like AI tools makes me feel isolated and depressed. I went to uni to get skills to help people, and getting an assignment from the web, analyzing data downloaded with the assignment, writing a report alone and then asking a chatbot what I did right/wrong feels impersonal. How do I know that my solutions will help people if the closest my work gets to someone is a task-sheet/submission link?",
