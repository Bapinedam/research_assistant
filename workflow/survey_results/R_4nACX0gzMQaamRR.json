    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I was worried about accidentally engaging in academic misconduct (e.g. accidently being too influenced by the feedback). I also often don't have time to proofread an assessment before submitting it, knowing this I edit as I write and have never thought to use GenAI to provide feedback on small pieces of work.",
