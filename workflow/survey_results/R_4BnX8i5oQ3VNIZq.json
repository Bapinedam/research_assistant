    "Response": "The use of AI is a lot more accessible, and therefore I use it a lot more than my lecturers, as they have hundreds of other students to attend to. However the quality is still not the same as the feedback from my lecturers. It has still had a very positive impact on my learning.",

    "Response": "Lecturers can be somewhat judgemental when teaching something that they feel is a little more elementary, whereas AI does not have that capacity and doesn't make me feel like less.",
