    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI excels at providing information and explanations, especially for factual or procedural knowledge. However, it may struggle with fostering deep, critical thinking or nuanced understanding in complex subjects. \nTeachers can engage students in discussions, debates, and critical analysis, helping them develop a deeper and more nuanced understanding of complex topics.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI: While GenAI can offer positive reinforcement, its encouragement is typically formulaic. \nTeacher: A teacher's feedback can be more motivating because it comes from someone who understands your progress, challenges, and potential. A teacher can tailor their encouragement to your specific needs, which can boost confidence and drive.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI: Some learners might feel less pressured by GenAI feedback because it is non-judgmental and lacks the personal expectations that a teacher might have. This can reduce anxiety, especially in a low-stakes learning environment.\nTeacher: Feedback from a teacher can sometimes create more pressure, especially if you value their opinion highly or if there are expectations to meet. While this pressure can be motivating for some, it can also increase anxiety for others.",
