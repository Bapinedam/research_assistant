  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Because GenAI feedback is less personal and more generalised it doesn't have any real effect on how I feel, it just feels useful for my studies. Sometimes feedback from teachers can feel a bit harsh and pointed (depending on the lecturer).",
