    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "An AI can give me feedback at any hour of the day when I want it whereas a teacher only checks their correspondence periodically throughout the day. This way I can get feedback when I am working on something rather than doing it wrong and having to wait for a teacher to check it.  And you don't look dumb asking AI whereas the teacher can always judge you.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI feedback always points out good things and then bad things, whereas a teacher may not. However AI can be tuned to say anything whether it just say its all good or whether to only give negative feedback. This can be useful however can be not good for students if asked to only give good feedback. I don't use it like this and ensure it says what need improvement. \n\nComing from a teacher also has potential for negative feedback to influence more than if a computer said it.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI provides a solution which can be adapted, whereas the teacher doesn't really provide good enough examples. \nAll information from an AI is stored so I can go back and look at what it said, whereas if I speak to a teacher I may forget what they said.",
