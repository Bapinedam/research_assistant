  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher can misunderstand, overthink question (somewhat often - they assume we're thinking deeper than what we ask quite frequently and think too critically about potential details, often missing the point). Also there's no social barrier to asking endless questions that would often annoy someone in real life. i.e. the same question asked 10 ways for 10 perspectives would generally need significant social effort to ensure that this conversation does not negatively impact on the teacher/tutor.",
