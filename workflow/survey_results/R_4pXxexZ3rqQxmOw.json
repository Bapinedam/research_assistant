    "Response": "it doesnot understand the projec flow and writing style of experiment design and reason why this is happening. Sometimes it happens that meaning of content becomes like selling something rather than telling something or providing some information of data.",

However AI don't have no idea about your content and topic because your teacher have much experience of handling data that make sense to applicability.
