    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Getting feedback from the teacher is more time consuming when compared to GenAI. Therefore, I often use GenAI in a pinch but I also consider my gut-feeling as well.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "From the teacher, I consider what they say to be more trustworthy and so their explanations give me an higher level of assurance while I generally consider the outputs from GenAI to have hallucinated or incorrect information and thus treat it with more skepticism.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI also sometimes produce less quality feedback which can sound very general and unhelpful. Teachers are less prone to provide such feedback.",
