    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Every lecturer gives a different type of feedback, some leave 2 sentences on the positives with no constructive criticism. \nAI at least - I can give the rubric descriptor, give it my paragraphs and ask it if it meets the criteria - it then tells me the positives where it does meet and what I can add to make it better.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback feels personal. I can envisage someone on the other end who can't be bothered reading 1000 essays, rushing through writing some half-assed feedback. \nGen AI is less personal and I feel like it has my best interest at heart.",
