    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is just able to provide a lot more detail in feedback because it obviously isn't bounded by class time or anything and it always understands the request for feedback. However, the feedback from teacher is pretty much every time more trustworthy since they're know the content I'm asking about very well.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI's feedback is very one dimensional as in it just gives your straight answers and comments about your question, whereas teachers take a lot more effort in explaining things i.e. using handwritten notation/diagrams etc.",
