    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Not overly much. Although a GenAI feedback may be more in depth, I would still trust my teachers feedback moreso, and would only use GenAI to supplement teacher feedback or use it when no teacher feedback is available.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI felt less trustworthy due to how it is still learning and is not an expert at certain things that my teacher would be. It still feels good using GenAI feedback as it is more indepth than a teachers, due to the fact that teachers have to spend time doing large amounts of feedback for students whereas a GenAI can do the work almost instantly.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "The teachers feedback was more concise and to the point, but sometimes difficult to gauge or understand. The GenAI gave a less detailed but easier to understand description of what was required. It is therefore difficult to compare the two as they are two different styles entirely.",
