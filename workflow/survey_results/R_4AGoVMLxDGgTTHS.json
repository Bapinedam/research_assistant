    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI gives overall ways to improve writting, not using specifics. It is good for getting a general idea, and again, overall rundown of your work. But it is the teacher that sets the criteria and knows what to look for whereas AI does not. the teacher is more reliable, and being a human can mean that they can give specific feedback on each sentence if needed.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback usualy made me feel assured that I was on the right track, and satisfied with overall concepts to change. Teachers were usuually harsher and more specific, but are more tailored to what acedamia is actually looking for.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "sometimes teachers can have a right or wrong mindset when marking or giving feedback, whereas most of the time, AI marks cohesiveness and understadnability or sentence structure, and kind of allows that what you have said must be what is being looked for.",
