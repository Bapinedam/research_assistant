    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Sometimes, ideas from GenAI can be too broad, providing an overview rather than detailed feedback. While GenAI offers general insights, feedback from teachers is considered expert opinion and can significantly enhance a student's knowledge and understanding in specific areas.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI has no bias regarding political views or beliefs, making it more comfortable to receive feedback from since it's emotionless. However, while feedback from teachers can sometimes be challenging, it prepares you for real-life experiences where human feedback can include both positive and negative aspects.",
