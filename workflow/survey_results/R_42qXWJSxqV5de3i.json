    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Personally, its the same but sometimes I have felt especially for programming or math that the AI was more complicated in its solution and sometimes that the teacher's methodology was a bit more complex. So, there has been different thoughts between them and contradictions, but I still regard AI giving about the same level of positivity as teachers in terms of learning.",
