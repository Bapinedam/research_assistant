    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "The privacy policies of GenAI are vague, and the very nature of the programs requires it to use new information to improve its future outcomes. Because of this, I don't input my actual writing/final product as there is always a chance of my own writing being flagged as plagiarised (very unlikely but not a risk I need to take)",
