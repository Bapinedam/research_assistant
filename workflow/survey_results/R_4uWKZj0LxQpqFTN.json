    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It's much more difficult to trust the feedback received from GenAI. Usually, I will only \"agree\" with the feedback if it aligns with something I was already thinking (or points my attention towards something that I hadn't already picked up on). Feedback from teachers is more likely to change my view/perspective about an issue, even where I disagree with the,.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
