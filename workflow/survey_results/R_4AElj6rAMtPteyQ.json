    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is great for me to get general knowledge of things I didn't know, I tend to have a lot of questions. Usually teachers have very limited time, so questions that came up while studying alone, couldn't be answered immediately.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I can use GenAI for feedback anytime and anywhere, usually alongside my study sessions. While a teacher has limited time. However, a teacher would give a more suitable answer for my needs, while GenAI would give a more general answer",
