    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is accessible after hours which is handy for when I am working late and need an answer immediately. I feel AI has been a great help in my assignment, specifically with coding. I do not use it to edit any university assignment writing because of copyright reasons, however if I am having an error in my code that I cannot understand it is very helpful in pointing out the error in my logic. Teachers can do this too, it is mostly the accessability",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "No real differences, for me teachers and AI fill different roles. I'd never use AI to answer a question if I have a teacher easily accessible to me.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I find that sometimes AI misses some details that teachers can see, sometimes it will try to give me an answer that I know is wrong and when I try to correct it it just gives me the same answer back.",
