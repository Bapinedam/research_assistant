    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Well, I may ask GenAI for general guidance on the perspectives to look at certain things. Also GenAI may be not specific enough in regards to improvements, I guess. It feels that GenAI lacks the personal touch, therefore, I would not ask for feedback from it. I have never tried. There is also intellectual property and privacy concerns.",
