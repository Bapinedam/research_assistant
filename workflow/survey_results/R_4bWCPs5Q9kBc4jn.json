    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Generation AI is not an intelligence in the way we traditionally understand it, rather it is a formulaic response that provides data based on what is available, it cannot critically think nor think at all. Hence, it is always preferable to have a trained academic staff member to provide feedback as they have genuine intellect.",
