    "Response": "Accessibility trumps all aspects... From my experience, if I ask a question from tutor on forums, I might get a response in may be few days time. With GenAI you can get instant answer. GenAI is not always correct, so you will have to do your own reasoning sometimes to better understand certain things which I found to be a great way to make mistakes, question back and understand subject better than cramming.",
