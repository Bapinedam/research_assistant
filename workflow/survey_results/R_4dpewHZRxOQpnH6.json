    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I guess with GenAI it's immediate and often, you get what you asked for. With teachers, the process can take a few hours or days if you're not in direct contact with them, which can be a hassle sometimes. And with teachers, although it's more catered to the individual, sometimes you might not understand the feedback.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I guess the feedback from teachers is more tuned to the individual and they might pick up on stuff that GenAI just couldn't, so I feel more assured when I get feedback from teachers.",
