    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI provides better easy of access for providing excellent individual feedback, and can work continuously with you, whereas feedback from a teacher is often less detailed but more reliable.\nLearning raw content from a teacher is more relevant, properly taught and a reliable source of teaching whereas GenAI can sometimes be unreliable but can help with a broad range of problems.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feels extremely versatile, with unlimited opportunities that can help me learn beyond the classroom. I still feel learning from a teacher is far more valuable for overall education, where AI is good at filling in gaps, bettering my knowledge and offering intelligent solutions to problems.",
