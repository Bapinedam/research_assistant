    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Although I think GenAI can be a great resource, it's also notoriously unreliable. Most GenAI right now also uses American spelling and grammar so I don't think it would make sense to use it to produce or edit text from an Australian English perspective. Using AI to brainstorm lets me sift through the ideas I think are helpful and those that are misguided rather than blindly trusting the text it produces.",
