    "Response": "GenAI is always there so it’s easy to ask questions to and ask you can ask it to rephrase their answers. TAs generally don’t give you much feeeback, its usually like a couple words. Also you generally don’t really get feedback except for a rubric and mark so you dont know where to improve. When i run a thing through chatgpt with a rubric attached it gives more feedback about what i can improve on.",
