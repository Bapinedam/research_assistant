    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback is usually more tailored around the specific assessment task whilst feedback provided by generative ai tends to be more focused on the broader topic as ai models typically donâ€™t have access to the specific course content of a class and instead go off all the topic pertaining to the task available on the internet",
