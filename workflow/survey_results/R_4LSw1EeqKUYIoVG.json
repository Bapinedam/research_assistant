    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The teacher is the one marking it, so even if what they say is nonsensical, that is how it will be marked so more relevant. AI will sometimes give suggestions for different marking criteria (eg suggesting first person for a scientific report based on it being the preferred format for a creative story)",
