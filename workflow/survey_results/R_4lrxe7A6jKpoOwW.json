    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I don't provide feedback on my work because I'm the one generating the responses, so self-assessment would be biased. Feedback is more effective when it comes from an external source, like a user or another system. If you have any feedback or suggestions, though, I'd be happy to hear them!",
