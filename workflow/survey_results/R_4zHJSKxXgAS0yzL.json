    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI can give direct advice on my assignments, many teachers at UTS will decline giving advice for assignments as they are not allowed to give direct unpaid advice for assessments which has happened countless times. So if the teachers on a policy standpoint cannot give feedback, I will take any sort of feedback I can get, GenAI can't give critical or creative insights but can give basic recommendations to improve the coherence and flow of my writing.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "A teacher will always have more personalised and insightful feedback but as I said previously sometimes teachers genuinely are not allowed to give students assignment feedback.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI will only ever be able to predict what the  most likely answer to my question will be, a teacher can give me genuine insight tailored to my needs. It is true however that teachers roles in the classroom will be questioned as AI improves. This is why I believe teachers in universities must be implementing AI as much as possible to prove they have the skills to teach students how to manage these issues. AI is a transdisciplinary tool which will become a necessity to keep up in every single industry.",
