    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When comparing the impact on my learning between GenAI feedback and my teacher's feedback, the differences were quite significant.\n\nGenAI feedback primarily impacted my learning by providing immediate answers and suggestions, which was incredibly useful for keeping up with my work and making quick corrections. This immediacy allowed me to address problems right away and helped me stay on track with my tasks. However, the feedback was often more surface-level, focusing on specific issues without delving into the underlying concepts. As a result, while it was great for short-term problem-solving, it didn't always contribute to a deeper understanding of the subject matter.\n\nOn the other hand, feedback from my teacher had a more substantial impact on my learning in the long run. My teacher's feedback was more holistic, often challenging me to think critically and explore different perspectives. This personalized approach not only helped me correct mistakes but also encouraged me to engage more deeply with the material. It pushed me to develop my analytical skills and fostered a more profound comprehension of the topics at hand.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When comparing the feedback from GenAI and my teacher, I noticed some key differences in how it made me feel. Feedback from GenAI is straightforward, immediate, and lacks any emotional undertones, which can be helpful when I want quick, objective advice without worrying about being judged. It's like getting a neutral second opinion, which is great for tasks that need efficiency and clarity.\n\nOn the other hand, feedback from my teacher feels more personal and impactful. There's a human connection in the way they understand my progress, struggles, and strengths, and that makes their feedback feel more meaningful. It’s not just about the content of the feedback but also the encouragement or constructive criticism that comes with it. I often feel more motivated to improve after hearing from my teacher because their feedback feels more tailored to me as an individual.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "One key difference between the feedback from GenAI and my teacher is the level of personalisation. GenAI feedback is consistent and unbiased, providing responses based on the information I input. It’s great for objective advice and often offers a broad range of suggestions. However, this feedback lacks the personal touch that comes from someone who knows my specific strengths, weaknesses, and learning style.\n\nIn contrast, my teacher's feedback is deeply personalised. They understand where I’ve struggled in the past, where I excel, and what my academic goals are. This allows them to tailor their advice not just to the task at hand, but to my overall development as a student. My teacher can offer context that AI can’t—such as how my work fits into the larger curriculum or how it aligns with industry standards.\n\nAnother difference is the nature of the communication. GenAI’s feedback is purely informational—it’s focused on the content and not on how that feedback might be received. It’s efficient but can sometimes feel impersonal. My teacher, on the other hand, often provides feedback in a way that’s encouraging and motivating. They might offer praise when I’ve done something well, or gently point out areas for improvement with an understanding of how to keep me motivated.\n\nFinally, there’s the difference in depth. GenAI can be very helpful for specific queries, but it may not always offer the depth of analysis that a human can. My teacher is able to provide more detailed explanations, draw from real-world experiences, and offer advice that considers the nuances of a subject, which often leads to a more comprehensive understanding.",
