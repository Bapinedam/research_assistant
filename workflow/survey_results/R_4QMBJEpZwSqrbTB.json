    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I personally believe that GenAI lacks the nuance that would allow for effective feedback on a task. If I ask for feedback on a task which asks to draw on classwork (e.g. readings, lecture material), GenAI cannot provide feedback on whether or not I effectively draw on past concepts and apply them to my work. A human with more specialised experience in my subjects is much more effective in this example.",
