    "Response": "Teacher's feedback is always given, no matter the mark, there is always an improvement. However, I have found it to be dependent on the marker and their opinions. GenAI is objective, through it's understanding of the internet.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Some of my teacher's feedback has never had depth, or gone into how I could improve as they have many people work to mark, and would then be required to go into depth for everyone. AI does go into depth and provides suggestions.",
