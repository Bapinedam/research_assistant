    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I think that it does not serve me academically to rely on an advanced language model to give me feedback, it also does not encourage skills that I may require to later find employment. \n\nI see the benefit of GenAI is really reducing the admin required to complete tasks, if it can help me condense information and develop an understanding of a topic then I see a great deal of benefit from its use. However, I want to develop MY skills and knowledge whilst at university, thus I do not use it to generate or evaluate any of my work.",
