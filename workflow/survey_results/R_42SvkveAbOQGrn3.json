    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI often generated generic feedback that wasn't actually relevant and didn't understand the nuances of my assignments. It wasn't really specific feedback and never matched the criteria or what I was going for.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I just don't really trust GenAI's feedback as it doesn't really understand the context of an assignment or any practical dimensions to university (eg: it cannot replicate the lived experience of a teacher who understand what skills need to be developed for future jobs etc.)",
