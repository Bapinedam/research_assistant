    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI provides factual, consistent, and prompt answers. It can offer various resources, methods of explanation, and perspectives quickly. However, it follows programmed responses and lacks the spontaneity or creativity that comes from years of teaching experience. A teacher can foster deeper learning through discussion, questioning, and exploration of abstract ideas.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI offers objective feedback without any emotional encouragement. While it can deliver factual feedback efficiently, it won't offer praise, empathy, or emotional support, which can be important for maintaining motivation and confidence. Teachers often combine their feedback with encouragement, which can be highly motivating. Even when providing criticism, they are more likely to balance it with positive reinforcement.",
