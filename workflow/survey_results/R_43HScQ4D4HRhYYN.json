    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I use AI  only as a guide for my studies for basic things such as the structure and some form of guidelines and not entirely depend on it. I prefer feedback from my lecturers than a machine. I also prefer to be authentic in the work I produce and not too reliant on someone.",
