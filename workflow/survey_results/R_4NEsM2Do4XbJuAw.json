    "Response": "The GenAI feedback sounds more formatted and sometimes vague, but it gives me areas where I can improve on and it is available 24/7. On the other hand, while teachers gave a more comprehensive feedback, they are not available all the time, and they might be reluctant to provide feedback when it comes to assessments",
