    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "A teacher gives course-specific advice, and understands the marking scheme. Hence, while both a teacher and AI can improve work and assist my learning, the teacher will likely push for improvements that focus on climbing the marking rubric (for better or for worse).",
