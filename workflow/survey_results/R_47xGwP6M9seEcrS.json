    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Pursuing an art degree, I think receiving feedback in terms of grammatical errors and structuring of creative tasks have been really helpful. Though, not often, there have been instances when feedback from AI has superimposed my teacher's.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI was more affirmative in response. As in it seemed to point out the changes that could be made only if asked in particular, which made me question it at first because the review could then be based on the inputs and style guide I had previoulsy applied for another task. This was bit distasteful in terms of its use.",
