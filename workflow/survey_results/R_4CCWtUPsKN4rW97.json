    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers are in general way less available than AI, which you can just search for instead of having to wait for a response, you can ask ai to reword something as many times as you’d like, but in general ai likes to make up things so is less trustworthy. Ai will never answer with I don’t know and will always say something even if it’s nonsense",
