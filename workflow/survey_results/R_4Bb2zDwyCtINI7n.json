    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI can answer questions anytime, which is very beneficial for self-directed learning. When facing unique questions, GenAI can quickly provide feedback, helping to resolve doubts immediately. GenAI's feedback is often interactive and can be tailored to your specific needs, making the learning process more dynamic and personalized.\nFor University Professors Feedback from professors is usually more in-depth, providing background knowledge and theoretical support, which helps in thoroughly understanding a subject. Professors not only provide answers but also guide you in how to think about problems, helping you develop critical thinking and research skills.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI: The feedback is immediate, interactive, and easily accessible, often highly personalized. However, it can sometimes feel mechanical or lack the warmth that comes from human interaction.\nUniversity Professors: Their feedback often carries a personal touch and encouragement, especially in face-to-face interactions. This type of interaction can be more motivating and confidence-boosting. Professors also focus on long-term academic growth.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Professors' feedback is usually more reliable and accurate due to years of teaching experience, whereas GenAI's feedback might sometimes require you to double-check its accuracy. Professors often provide more detailed explanations, background information, and additional resources for further study, helping you gain a deeper understanding of a topic. In contrast, GenAI is more focused on quickly answering specific questions, which might lack depth.",
