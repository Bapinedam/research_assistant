    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI was able to teach me things in an easier language than what my teacher was saying as sometimes I would lose the teacher and fall behind. This would mainly be due to the fact that I fall asleep in class or don't watch the lectures and all, but  still being able to be taught on the fly was a good thing for me and my learning rather than being stationary and not doing anything but sit and take notes. I learn by doing, not by sitting and listening.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yeah. GenAI understood the rubric the same way that I did and I guess it gave me a false sense of security when I heard from the teacher that it was just okay and not up to a high distinction standard.",
