    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "As I known, Many university tutors in China, they use the GenAI to redesign the project illegal (including the firewall and the permission of openAI account) by GenAI. But they will not collect the AI reference in the end editing list. That's really influenced my opinion of using AI. As I arrived here, the rules using GenAI let me know how to use them avoid polluting the design market.",
