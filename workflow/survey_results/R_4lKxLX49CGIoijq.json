    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I think teachers' advice and feedback are more heuristic. Because when using AI, you need to keep asking questions to inspire AI. The more information you provide, the more likely it is that AI would provide you with accurate messages. For teachers, they have experiences on how to teach and inspire students, this is a totally different thing.",
