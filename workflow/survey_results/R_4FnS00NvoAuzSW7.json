    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is usually more generic and sometimes does not understand the whole context for a task and therefore the answer may not always fit and I still need to make human judgments. My teachers usually give direct feedback, although it may not always be detailed.",
