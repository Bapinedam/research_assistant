    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI can be more detailed, I can ask it very annoying, repetitive questions and really get to the ntitty gritty of minute details without actually annoying anyone, but it I also can't be as confident in what it says, especially around any subject matter things. Good for things like structure / referencing / layout / or picking up on silly mistakes, but teachers obviously provide more relevant, reliable feedback, however I also feel sometimes teacher feedback can be more biased, more repetitive, and frustrating as an online student as I don't really feel like I can ask for clarification on my feedback",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I don't feel anything about AI feedback, I only ask it for pretty straightforward things, teacher feedback can often make me frustrated, as mentioned above sometimes it feels like I can't really ask for clarification on feedback and more often than not negative feedback is detailed in what I did wrong or not well enough, and good feedback is just \"good point\" \"correct\" \"yes\" which makes it easy to only focus on the negative",
