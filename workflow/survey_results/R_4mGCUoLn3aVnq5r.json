  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The guidance provided by Generative AI is more immediate compared to that of a teacher. Additionally, Gen AI offers a broader perspective and richer content. When it comes to interdisciplinary topics, its insights tend to be more comprehensive and holistic.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "A teacher's response is undoubtedly more focused on the final grading of the project, while Gen AI's answers tend to address the problem itself in a more thorough and well-rounded manner.",

  },
  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "This issue depends on the specific context. Generally, a teacher will provide one solution direction and then delve deeper into the details of that approach. In contrast, Gen AI might offer multiple solutions during the first inquiry, although these solutions may vary in quality. Of course, we can continuously refine the model using prompt engineering to optimize its responses, guiding it to offer the best solution and the detailed steps for implementing it.",
