    "Response": "Teacher much more useful and direct in responses. Very good at explaining concepts- sometimes it's blatantly obvious that GenAI is just regurgitating the first paragraph of Wikipedia at you.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
