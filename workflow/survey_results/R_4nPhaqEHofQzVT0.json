  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "While I don't have feelings, for students, feedback from a teacher might feel more personal and motivating because it's tailored with human understanding and empathy. GenAI feedback is quick and objective but lacks the emotional connection and encouragement that a teacher can provide.",
