    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I find the feedback I get from my markers are very detailed and personalised to the content and materials used in the seminar. I feel that GenAI wouldnt have that historical knowledge and would not know exactly what the Unit lecturers are looking for. I feel that GenAI can possibly give feedback on structure of my work, but not on specific details.",
