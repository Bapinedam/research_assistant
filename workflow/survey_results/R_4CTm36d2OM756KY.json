    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The teacher's feedback was much more tailored to learning outcomes they knew I had, and I liked that it showed an understanding of who I am as a person and my broader circumstances. The GenAI feedback was somewhat useful in that teachers/staff can be very busy and sometimes leave feedback so vague that it's genuinely distressing or unhelpful (or in the worst of cases, suffers from a clear lack of attention to detail). Furthermore, GenAI feedback was always polite and constructive, but unfortunately I can't say the same about all teacher/staff feedback.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Generally I prefer teacher/staff feedback as I feel more valued and understood as a fellow person, and for me, solid, constructive feedback from teachers positively contributes to our professional relationship. However, in cases of vague, unclear, feedback and/or feedback with harsh, unhelpful wording from teachers/staff, this *also* had a greater impact on me emotionally. GenAI feedback feels pretty neutral by comparison, but also very frustrating when it's not properly tailored to the prompt and/or lacking depth.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback more frequently lacks depth and/or ignores key details within the prompt. Teacher feedback tends to show greater understanding of student circumstances and my unique learning context beyond just the 1 assessment piece. GenAI can be a 'safer bet' in that it *always* takes on a polite and constructive tone, but feels much lower quality overall.",
