    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I try to be very critical when I use to get feedback from an AI and try as much it can to give me unbiased feedback and so my assessment ends being much better as I would have improved certain areas and this makes the feedback from tutors and lecturers mostly positive as there's nothing to very little to improve thus giving me a much happier feeling but also due to the fact that it was coming from a real human.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI is not very critical and most of the time the feedback I got back heavily was dependent on how good the prompt was and sometimes I find myself going back and forth several times in a long thread of texts for it act exactly like how I wanted it to.",
