    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I'm afraid the companies are using the feedback (my side of the conversation) to feed into the training model again, so I haven't sent my uni work to genAI before. I'm pretty sure they say they don't, but I err on the side of caution. I have spell check anyway (which might be the same but you can only do so much)",
