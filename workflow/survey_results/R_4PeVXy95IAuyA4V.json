    "Response": "The only feedback edits I've used are the error highlights on word docs/google docs, so I'm not sure whether or not that counts as GenAl, but it was very helpful in picking up small typing errors and providing quick feedback. Feedback from the teacher is also helpful but on a deeper level/ based more on my approach to a certain point, etc.",
