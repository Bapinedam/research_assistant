    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I just have not used it. I have used a GenAI tool to summarize papers, and when I checked back on the papers, the results were not satisfactory with the GenAI results. Based on that experience, I think need to be careful when using GenAI in my work, including for feedback.",
