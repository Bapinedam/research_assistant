    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I only used the GenAI tool for some minor parts of the overall body of work and did not have a high degree of confidence that it was capable of understanding the entire piece to be able to produce meaningful feedback, aside from spell and grammar checks. Further, I did not trust the tool to not use my work for its own training.",
