    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "feedback from tutors is often delayed by weeks, and I'm conscious that they are not paid for the time they spend helping students outside of class. AI can give advice throughout the editing process, before submission, which tutors often cannot do (since they're also grading it)",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I can request specific feedback from AI, and ask for specific suggestions on how to do things differently. This process takes a longer time for a human to analyse the work and give workable suggestions, and I don't feel bad telling a robot that its advice was useless and to try again.",
