    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is more objective. I’ve had opinionated teachers try to fail me purely because they can’t lower their egos, and I’ve had to fight for my grades by going to their superior. Some teachers will not provide marks and give no explanation. However, teachers are more qualified than AI, and are more likely to give a more trustworthy and enriching  opinion.",
