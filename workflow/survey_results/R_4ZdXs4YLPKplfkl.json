    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "it's easier to get instant feedback from chatGPT then ask my tutor. Most classes aren't even necessary to go to, so travelling an hour into the city just to ask my teacher a question or email them and hope they get back to me in a timely manner is a waste of my personal time. I can ask chatGPT and get a somewhat OK answer from it and just go from there, saving me time to do other things.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes chatGPTs feedback is sometimes super generic sounding and not that helpful so it makes me frustrated and I end up figuring out stuff myself instead.",
