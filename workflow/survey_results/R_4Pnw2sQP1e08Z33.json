    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The almost instantaneous feedback that can be tailored and refined specifically for what I was asking was almost like having a live tutor 1:1 assisting me, which helped me learn so much more than asking a question online and waiting days for a response which may not have completely been understood or relevant.",
