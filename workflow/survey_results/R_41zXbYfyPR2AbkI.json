    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI goes into a lot more depth when giving feedback. You can also ask GenAI to expand on certain points in more detail. On the other hand, feedback from the teacher can sometimes be shallow, without actually telling you what the problem is in-depth.",
