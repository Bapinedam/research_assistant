  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Using GenAI to obtain feedback was instant, comprehensive and generally more insightful. The teacher was unfortunately brief and unclear, likely due to the amount of feedback they were required to give. I was able to progress my understanding of my shortcomings and strengths much quicker when using GenAI.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The teacher's brief comments made me feel like a 'number on a page', with very little insight or care put into the comments. GenAI made me feel a little pandered to, with compliments liberally sprinkled through the other, useful feedback.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI can follow a tree-like structure of conversation much more naturally than a teacher, where I can start the conversation from a previous point and follow a different line of thinking. This makes it far easier to have in-depth conversations about each piece of feedback. GenAI also has much more 'time' to spend going over difficult sections.",
