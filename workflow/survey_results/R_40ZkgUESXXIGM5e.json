    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I think that GenAI may add a little more detail to some of the content. However, the teacher is generally the person that sets the tasks and knows what is important for their marking. Therefore, some of the content that GenAI may provide is not relevant for all classes.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I will generally use prompts with GenAI to help simplify certain information so that it is easier for me to understand the content. Sometimes with teachers I don't feel as comfortable constantly asking them what things mean over and over again. I'm sure they would get a little annoyed by that too because they only have a small amount of time they can offer students.",
