    "Question": "Why didn’t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because why would I? It doesn’t know the Rubric, it doesn’t have an opinion as of yet, it doesn’t know what it’s looking for beyond what you ask of it. A teacher would not only give you feedback but also extend the invitation to help you. AI won’t.",
