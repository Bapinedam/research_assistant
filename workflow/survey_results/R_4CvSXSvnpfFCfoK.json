    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I haven't really considered using GenAI for feedback on my work as 1) it never crossed my mind to do that 2) I don't really know how effective it would be (e.g. I'm still a bit skeptical towards using genAI for feedback as my work is ultimately being graded by humans and not AI) 3) I don't really know how to do that",
