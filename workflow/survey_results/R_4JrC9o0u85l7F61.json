  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Sometimes feedback from teacher is somewhat clearer/more interactive than AI and does not need more time to processes. GenAI can give more feedback but sometimes lack of explain and often need to prompt more input to get more detailed explainations/feedback",
