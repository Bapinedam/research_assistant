  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When seeking feedback from GenAI for feedback, a collaboration/conversation can immediately happen. Where there can be examples used, or explanations to deepen understanding. Whereas when receiving feedback from a teacher, there is no way to have an open conversation about the feedback and sometimes the feedback can be really brief or not descriptive, or what I have had recently, completely unrelated to my work.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI makes me feel happy, and supported. Where as feedback from teachers, I find, can be quiet genetic and cold. Being able to have that open conversation on feedback while receiving it, does open it up to be more receptive to the feedback, as well as being able to apply the feedback instantly, or discuss examples, etc.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
