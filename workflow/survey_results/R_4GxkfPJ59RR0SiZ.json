  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The feedback from GenAI helps with immediate problem-solving and is great for quick revisions or general guidance, but it doesn’t provide the deeper, contextualized insights that my university teacher does. Teacher feedback is more impactful for long-term growth because it helps me understand complex ideas in the context of the subject, guiding me on how to improve not just for one assignment, but for future work.\n\nIn summary, GenAI is a great tool for efficiency and on-demand assistance, but teacher feedback has a more profound impact on my overall learning journey because it’s personalized, detailed, and rooted in academic expertise.",
