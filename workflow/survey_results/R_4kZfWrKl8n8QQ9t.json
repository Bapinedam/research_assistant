  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI impacts learning by providing personalized, immediate support, and is available 24/7, making it a valuable resource outside of class. However, it lacks the human connection, empathy, and motivational support that a teacher offers. While GenAI delivers instant feedback and can simplify complex concepts, it can't fully replicate the hands-on experiences or deep understanding of a student's needs that a teacher provides. Thus, GenAI complements traditional teaching but doesn't replace the essential role of a teacher in education.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI can feel neutral and purely informational, as it lacks the human touch and emotional understanding that a teacher provides. While GenAI offers quick, direct answers, it may not provide the encouragement or personalized insights that can motivate and inspire. In contrast, feedback from a teacher often feels more supportive and tailored, acknowledging your efforts and offering guidance in a way that can build confidence and foster a deeper connection to the learning material.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "One key difference is that GenAI feedback is immediate and always available, offering instant clarification and solutions. However, it tends to be more general and lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning style that a teacher can offer. A teacher's feedback is often more personalized, considering your progress, strengths, and areas for improvement, and it might include constructive criticism delivered with empathy and encouragement that can be more impactful for long-term learning.",
