    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I was confident in my work and the feedback I had gotten from my tutors and professors. I have never used GenAI for feedback on work before, so I am not sure if I would trust its feedback to improve my work and ideas. I like to be unique and original in the work I produce, and having GenAI edit or change it would not reflect my own knowledge or skills.",
