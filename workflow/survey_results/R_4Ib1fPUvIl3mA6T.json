    "Response": "Generative AI, while offering accurate responses, often provides broad explanations compared to the detailed and precise instruction typically given by teachers. Despite this, AI's responsiveness and decisiveness make it a valuable tool for students, particularly for those who are neurodivergent, such as those with ADHD. Unlike traditional classroom settings where students might fear judgment or worry about wasting their teacherâ€™s time, AI allows them to explore a wide range of connected topics freely.This freedom is especially beneficial for curious and intuitive minds. The unstructured and unbiased nature of AI-generated responses encourages students to delve deeper into subjects at their own pace. AI is not influenced by human conditions such as fatigue, stress, or personal biases that might affect a teacher's ability to engage consistently and fairly with every student. Instead, it provides objective, punctual information, allowing students to focus on the content without the limitations or subjective interpretations that can arise in traditional teaching environments.In conclusion, while teachers excel at emphasizing the importance of ideas and concepts, the flexibility and impartiality of AI create an ideal learning environment for neurodivergent individuals. The absence of inherent bias and human conditions makes AI a powerful tool for fostering curiosity and deeper connections with the material, without the constraints of traditional instruction.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from generative AI felt less personal, which, as a neurodivergent individual, helped me overcome feelings of 'personal failure' and stubbornness. Knowing that the response wasn't influenced by human bias or personal opinion allowed me to engage more openly with the feedback, without the emotional weight of feeling judged.",
