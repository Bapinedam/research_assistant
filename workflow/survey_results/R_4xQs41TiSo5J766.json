    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI: \n- provide detailed feedback on specific areas that need improvement \n- easier to seek for help \nFor example, I often copy and paste the success criteria with my draft and ask AI how I can improve my writing to meet those criteria. Instead of having AI rewrite my work entirely, I use it to identify what information might be missing, which sections need more evaluation, or where further explanation is needed etc. which is kind of stuff that I used to get marked down while I was in high school. \n\nTeacher: \n- Can be difficult to address directly with teachers due to assessment rules or personal nervousness. \n- definitely the most trustworthy",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback can sometimes come across as very formal and strict, which can feel intimidating. While it's always valuable, the way itâ€™s delivered might make it seem less approachable or supportive at times. Whereas AI gives feedback in more friendly and positive tone that encourages me.",
