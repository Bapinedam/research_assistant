    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is collaboratively, so I can ask it to clarify feedback and revise my content and ask for more feedback. Teachers are less accessible and feedback is given on an assignment retrospectively, rather than in real time. Therefore, I feel I learn much quicker with GenAI feedback and can implement it straight away, rather than reading once and forgetting/not be able to change it",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I have RSD so teacher feedback feels judgmental and feels a lot more harsh and less suggestive of alternative ways to do things, GenAI is more objective and makes helpful suggestions I can action in real time. The objectivity of GenAI makes it feel less of an attack/trigger to my RSD and more collaborative and judgement-free, more like asking a helpful friend, rather than an authority figure",
