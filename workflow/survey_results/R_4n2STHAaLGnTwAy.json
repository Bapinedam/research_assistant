    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I am able to ask a wider and more detailed array of questions to GenAI than I am to my teacher. The answers often pull from a wider range of sources and allow me to continuously clarify until I gain the understanding that I'm looking for.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I often take the feedback I've been given on an assignment and upload that with my assignment and the rubric and ask GenAI to show me how the feedback applies practically to what I've written. The feedback given in assessments is generally good and specific to why you lost marks, but doesn't go the step further of showing you examples of what the marker actually means in application to your writing.",
