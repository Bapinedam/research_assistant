    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because I didn't see the point of asking AI to give me feedback when it can't really capture what would make my assignment good or better and only gave general advice as compared to my tutors who provide clear and concise feedback and I'm more likely to improve my work knowing that a person who's a professional in the subject I'm learning is marking me.",
