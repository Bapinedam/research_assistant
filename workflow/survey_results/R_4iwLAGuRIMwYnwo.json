    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI picks up on a lot of details that could be improved, not all of which are directly relevant to the assignment task. This also means it gives a broader scope/context for the assignment though, which can be better for overall learning and understanding the content more thoroughly as opposed to just doing well on the assignment.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher's feedback feels more direct - they're ultimately the one marking the assignment so I trust what they're saying a lot more. AI is usually very nice and couches their feedback but can sometimes just be entirely incorrect, which can be very confusing.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI provides a lot longer winded, less succinct answers. Teacher's answers, on the other hand, can be more vague.",
