  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I feel more annoyed by the feedback given by my teachers if they do not agree with what I wrote as it feels like they could have better conveyed their expectations for the assignment. however, I do feel happier and more satisfied when I receive positive feedback from my teachers as it confirms for myself that I have completed the assignment correctly according to what they have wanted. for GenAI, I don't really have much feeling when I get its feedback, except that maybe it makes me feel more confident in my work to have affirmation from it.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI considers all possible points but sometimes the teachers focus more on points that they are already looking at, even if I have raised relevant points in my assignment. \nfor past papers, teachers are unable to release answers which significantly hinders my preparation for exams so using GenAI to get feedback is a way to be able to check my learning (even if it may not always be the most accurate)",
