    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I get feedback on my work from my teachers, I doubt I could get better feedback from AI. Although in the future if I get really terrible/unhelpful feedback I could see myself asking AI to help me understand where I went wrong in an assignment, but I do not think it would be as good as human feedback.",
