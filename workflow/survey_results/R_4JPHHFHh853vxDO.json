    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I don't necessarily trust most of the information put out by GenAI in general, so when using it, I use it very sparingly and when I'm in a tough situation (I really can't think of ideas, I need a 'different' opinion etc.) \n\nBecause of this, I don't use it for feedback as I know I have peers and my tutors/lecturers that I can go to for more in depth and sufficient feedback.",
