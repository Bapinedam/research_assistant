    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI has more 'time' to give detailed feedback, you can input every part of your work and ask it to compare with a rubric and assignment instructions. It allows me to improve my work before submitting it. Teachers are giving the feedback after the work is completed which means you can't action the feedback.",
