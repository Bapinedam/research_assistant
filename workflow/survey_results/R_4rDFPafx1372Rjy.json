    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "sometimes AI would only provide positive feedback whereas my teacher could draw upon our conversations to inform their feedback or they would have a better understanding of what kind of feedback would help me. The specificity was what stood out. AI is very general whereas my teacher could annotate my work in a way that connected with my and my learning in their classroom. Especially for a subject like literature I cannot overestimate my appreciation for my tutors comments and feedback. I also liked being able to talk to my teacher about the feedback and get immediate, personalised clarification. That is something I have found very frustrating with AI is when you ask it to be more specific, it rarely is able to match your demands.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Definitely. I was much more emotionally receptive to the feedback of my teacher whereas I was indifferent and uninspired by that given by AI. In essence, I value to input of my teacher a lot more than the AI because I have built a relationship with them and that inspires me to do as well as I can. AI can't explore the nuances the same way as a human can and I think in any kind of pedagogical or andragogical environment, human contact and mentorship on every level is essential.",
