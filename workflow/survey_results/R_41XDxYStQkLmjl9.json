    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "In terms of writing, while GenAI certainly helps in terms of proofreading, the output does not necessarily align with the preference or expectation of a teacher or supervisor, although the latter can be quite unstable and subjective at times.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "If the teacher is the target audience of the work, it is apparently more straightforward to obtain feedback from it in terms of improving the outcome. Using GenAI is more like trying to get the best outcome by second-guessing yourself.",
