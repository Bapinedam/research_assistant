    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is generally unable to provide a contextualised response as feedback provided by GenAI is purely off the input that it is given. Getting feedback from a teacher is much more credible as they have marked and assessed such skills and approaches to assessments in the past, and would likely know the best approach/how to improve a current approach.",

    "Response": "Yes. Feedback from my teacher gave me much more clarity and confidence when approaching assessment/s however due to the nature of AI, it was not the most credible resource for feedback.",
