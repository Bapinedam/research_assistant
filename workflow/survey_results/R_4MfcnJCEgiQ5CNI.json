    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI is imediate feedback that I can usually tell if it will be helpful or not, the more information about the assignment or project, the better the feedback.\nTeachers take a while, which is understandable, but I have rarely received something more than one line or something that I can apply to another assignment. The feedback by teachers for me ends up being rather pointless.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Honestly, AI's make me feel better because I know I can gat valuable feedback withing a good time frame. This is not to say I think AI's should be substituted for teachers, if uni's do that, it's going to be just as unreliable as the teachers. When I look to AI for feedback, I know my input and can edit the prompts to get me better feedback.",
