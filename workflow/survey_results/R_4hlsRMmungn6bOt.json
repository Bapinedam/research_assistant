    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "As a master's student, I find the guidance from teachers crucial, especially with the abundance of new research and unfamiliar tasks. However, I often can't reach out to teachers frequently, so for more minor questions, I explore answers on my own by using Google, consulting ChatGPT, referring to subject outlines, and seeking advice from senior students. While I don't fully rely on ChatGPT, I combine its insights with other resources for a more informed approach.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I donâ€™t fully trust Generative AI because it can sometimes provide incorrect answers. I often have to rephrase my questions multiple times to get responses that make sense and align with what I know, especially considering my field of study. While I use GenAI as a tool, I always cross-reference its information with other sources to ensure accuracy.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Aside from Trustworthy, I don't find any other significant differences. I wish I had more opportunities to receive feedback from my teachers, but I understand they are often busy and may not be as readily available as GenAI.",
