    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI merely gives feedbacks about general and common mistakes and has no ability to put our writing in an appropriate context to assess it. By contrast, my teacher can clearly explain what is going on in my writing ( mistakes by context/how to use formal tone following the kind of papers).",
