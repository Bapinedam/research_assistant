    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "feedback from AI is much more thorough and clearly delivered so you know how to change but teacher feedback is more subjective so it can be very useful when they have unique insights from their own knowledge and experience but also can be unhelpful when they want things done a specific way and not every operates well that way.",
