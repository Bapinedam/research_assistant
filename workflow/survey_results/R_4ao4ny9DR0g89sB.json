    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI provided a highly personalized learning experience, allowing me to ask multiple follow-up questions as soon as I encountered a doubt. This instant access to information was invaluable, unlike with teachers, where there can sometimes be a communication gap or limitations due to restricted contact hours or reliance on help desks.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When I receive feedback from GenAI, I tend to be cautious and don't immediately believe it without doing my own research. However, it serves as a good starting point, especially when I'm struggling to get started. In contrast, feedback from my teacher feels more reliable and trustworthy right away, as it comes from someone with experience and knowledge of the subject.",
