  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback is more useful and beneficial for my learning as I trust my teacher's expertise more than a large language model. However, sometimes GenAI would give me more detailed feedback, and I am sometimes more inclined to use it for feedback than a teacher due to anonymity and accessibility.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I am more likely to take feedback personally from a teacher than GenAI. This is because I trust my teachers more and GenAI has the anonymity factor which means I am less likely to feel judged/vulnerable.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Since teachers are often the ones prescribing and marking assessment tasks, their feedback is likely more useful and accurate. GenAI can sometimes give irrelevant or useless feedback due to not knowing enough about the task requirements or content.",
