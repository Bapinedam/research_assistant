  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI can be tailored to request specific feedback on work by adjusting questions if feedback doesn't answer the question/requested feedback directly. It's also instant and saves time.\nReaching out to a teach can take time, be difficult to understand and may also be too late (feedback after an assignment is received)",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Being able to adjust questions and get feedback immediately with AI - for example, asking if I'm on the right track with my train of thought for an assignment - makes me feel more encouraged in my ability to complete the task.\nAs receiving feedback takes time from teachers, this leaves me feeling uncertain until the feedback is received - plus, a lot of the time teachers are unable to be direct in answering whether I'm on the right track. \nOverall, the GenAI makes me feel better",
