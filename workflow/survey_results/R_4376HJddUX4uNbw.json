    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI can speed up learning by providing immediate help, but there's a lack of depth. In contrast, teacher feedback is more valuable for long-term learning because it is based on personal interaction. It can offer more trust and deeper insights as it comes from an established expert person.",
