    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Because I think the teacher is on the right track, but what GenAI might be based on I'm not sure, so overall it's still the teacher's influence that's more important",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI always gives me positive feedback or some very general, not in-depth feedback, but the teacher's feedback feels spot on. So I trust the teacher's feedback more, but also gain confidence from GenAI's feedback.",

    "Response": "GenAI will write very long feedbacks, but they are superficial and do not allow for deep understanding; teacher feedback is usually shorter, but points out practical problems",
