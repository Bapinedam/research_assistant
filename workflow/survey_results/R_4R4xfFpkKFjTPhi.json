    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When my tutor gives really vague answers to my question that is of no help at all, Gen AI can sometimes help to push me in the correct direction when i ask the same question. And sometimes when i don't understand the content of my lecture, Gen AI helps to direct me to certain websites to learn, like how microsoft copilot references websites and links them.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "For feedback by my teacher, i feel that it is sometimes insufficient and sometimes vague, but this differs across different teachers. The same can be said some Gen AI. Some products like chatGPT is not useful while some like copilot or gemini is more insightful.",
