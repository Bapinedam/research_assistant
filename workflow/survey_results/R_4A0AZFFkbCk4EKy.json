    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "In terms of learning, I learned little from the teacher and not that much from GenAI. In my experience, GenAI gives more instruction on ways of writing while teachers critique the information and presentation. I learn how to write compellingly from teachers, I learn how teachers want me to write from GenAI.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Messages about how to change my writing and the strengths I already have in writing made me feel more important when my teacher gave them to me. When GenAI gives editing help I don't feel anything towards it.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI gives much more feedback that can be used directly than Teachers. By this, I mean in sheer volume the comments on a piece of writing will be more and most suggestions can be implemented using or removing a couple of words while teachers give feedback that could help you in the long term but may be much more difficult to incorporate in work.",
