    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI supports me to understand concepts in a way that makes sense to me with how I process new information. I take a while to fully understand new concepts and like to have it explained simply and without jargon, so using GenAI to help me learn has been a God send, especially as an online student.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is really good at offering supportive feedback while also providing constructive feedback too. Because I have input my preferences for the language it uses in our chats it gels well with my communication style. This is not something I can do with teachers, though I have felt most feedback I've received from teachers/markers at Deakin has been really great too, but of course the feedback is not consistent like GenAI is because the markers and teachers change for each new unit.",
