    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "During the learning process, the teacher provided me with humane guidance and emotional support, which GenAI cannot completely replace. However, the immediacy and extensiveness of GenAI allows me to manage my learning progress more autonomally and get a personalized learning experience. Overall, GenAI and the teacher have each enriched my learning experience in different ways, enabling me to benefit greatly in the acquisition and application of knowledge. The combination of the two makes my learning process more comprehensive and efficient.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "In general, teacher feedback is more human and can provide emotional support and personalized advice, which is suitable for solving complex situational problems. GenAI's feedback is more efficient, broad, and consistent, suitable for quick information acquisition and multi-angle understanding of problems. Both of them play an irreplaceable role in different learning situations, and when combined, they can meet my needs at different levels in the learning process.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "the feedback from a teacher is deeply personalized, contextually rich, and emotionally supportive, while GenAI offers efficiency, breadth, and consistency in its feedback. Both have their place in the learning process, with teachers providing a more human touch and GenAI offering scalable, immediate assistance.",
