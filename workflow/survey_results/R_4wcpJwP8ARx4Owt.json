    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because it is very generic and I like to be specific and to the point. I like to back my research with real life examples, experiences and case studies which ai doesn't provide. I like to immerse myself in the subject I am learning. Ai would make me lazy and i wouldn't learn anything with spoon feeding",
