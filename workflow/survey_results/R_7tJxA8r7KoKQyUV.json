    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI has been very useful in my learning. I am very interested in learning new ideas. However, because of a very tricky childhood, I struggled in school, so I don't feel equipped with the specific skill set that university requires. AI has helped bridge the gap and helped me understand writing styles, improve my grammar and explain things more simply.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I feel teachers can focus too much on trying not to give you any answers and not get into the weeds with you, so if they explain something, it often feels like it's the most prolonged and confusing way. AI explains something very simply, or if you still don't understand, you can ask it to explain it differently.",
