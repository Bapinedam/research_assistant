    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is non judgemental, I can say anything and not feel like that they think I'm an idiot. Freeing in that sense\nIf a teacher is helpful it can be a pivotal move to making me appreciate the course a lot more. A smile, positive attitude and reassurance can go a long way for your mental health. Obviously not all teachers are equal, some may make me feel insecure, or I can't understand their speech, for example.",
