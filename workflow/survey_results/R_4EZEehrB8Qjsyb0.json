    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Using artificial intelligence helps me avoid asking questions in class that might seem silly or trivial because I don't want to appear foolish. Instead, I can ask AI those concepts, and it explains them thoroughly, helping me understand them. Additionally, since English is not my first language, I can use AI for paraphrasing, finding the right words, and correcting my grammatical mistakes. In my graduate studies, it’s not common to take up the teacher’s time with such questions, so AI allows me to learn these things easily and efficiently.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes, the feedback I usually receive from my teacher focuses more on the analytical and scientific aspects of the paper, while the feedback I get from artificial intelligence mainly addresses grammar and writing style. That’s why I believe these two types of feedback are completely different.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Sometimes, artificial intelligence provides feedback that, if applied to an essay, can lead the writing in the wrong direction because it doesn’t fully understand our intent behind the analysis and writing. However, a teacher would never give incorrect feedback on an assignment because they know exactly what we are supposed to analyze and achieve.",
