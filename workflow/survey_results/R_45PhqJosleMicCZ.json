    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers are one of the most important roles in my learning experience. I can get new ideas and new perspectives from them. They are more trustworthy and by going face-to-face with them, I can feel more confident. GenAI is used when I want to give some useful and interesting information for my study, mainly researching programs.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Generally speaking, when simply considering the feelings, there is not really a big difference. I know I can get feedback from both GenAI and teachers, but is just face-to-face talking or words.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teachers tend to give me feedback more based on how I performed and some useful documents or resources that I can use to improve. GenAI usually gives feedback in a general form. However, it is easier to ask for more from GenAI as it can output as many as you want.",
