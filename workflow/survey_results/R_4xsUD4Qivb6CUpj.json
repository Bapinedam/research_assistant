    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI provided me instant feedback on a problem I was currently experiencing, allowing me to continue to work without having to stop and come back later after asking the question is say a tutorial or ed discussion board. I only have used this for programming and it was very helpful but for any math's questions I have its useless. My teachers feedback is similarly instant (in tutorials) and usually similarly effective at solving my problem, usually a bit better than AI (more personalized to my lack of understanding as apposed to a blanket explanation of the topic).",
