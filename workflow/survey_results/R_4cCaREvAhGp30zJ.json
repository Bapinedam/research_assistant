    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I find teacher’s marking to be so incredibly broad, with how many they have to mark I don’t blame them. I can ask very specific questions to AI and get an answer. With AI, you always have to comprehend what it’s saying and think critically about the output, but at least with your teachers you don’t have to worry too much about them knowing what they’re talking about if that makes sense.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "More comprehensive from AI, less so from my teachers, so it makes me feel more confident in my work as I have asked AI a range of different questions re: proofreading. I often feel lost and deflated after teacher’s feedback - you put so much work into an assignment just to get a short paragraph in marking that is impersonal and broad.",
