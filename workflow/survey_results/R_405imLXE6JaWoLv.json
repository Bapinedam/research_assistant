    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers are able to give constructive and specific feedback, particularly as it applys to the scope of the unit or the assignment itself. They can draw the links between the different parts of the same assignment, and tell you where exactly you need to improve. GenAI can only help you improve the exact written example youve been given. The feedback can be very surface level, or unhelpful as it can not link whats expected from the assignment to whats been written.",
