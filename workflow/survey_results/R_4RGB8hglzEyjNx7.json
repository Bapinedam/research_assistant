    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "To be honest, if I can provide a rubric of an assessment, GenAi will usually give more patient and detailed feedback. I guess it's because the teachers are always too busy. However, the teachers are always more specific on certain requirements that AIs may potentially ignore. The key is to combine both feedback to allow a deeper reflection and further improvements.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I'm not saying that teachers will lose their jobs because of AI. In contrast, AI can help them generate more personalised and detailed feedback which they can refer to to further instruct students' performances.",
