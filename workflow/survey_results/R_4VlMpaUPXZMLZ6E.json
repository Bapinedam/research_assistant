    "Response": "AI is more instant feedback which helps for when you are on a tight schedule. However, it is usually untrustworthy and what it says must be taken with a grain of salt.\nThe teacher may not get back to you instantly, or you may be afraid to approach them for help. However their advice is a lot more sound.",
