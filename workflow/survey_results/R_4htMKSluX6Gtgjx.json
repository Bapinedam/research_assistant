    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI feedback is instant and more likely to be objective (at least according to the software). Depending on how much leighway is introduced in an assessment rubric, a teachers feedback can be very subjective and not necessarily align with the ability or style of a student. This issue is compounded in larger classes where teachers are less likely to have a large amount of time to provide personal feedback or feeback at all in a timely manner.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from generative AI is usually regarding sentence structure, gramatical errors and objective faults with the content of the work. Feedback from Teachers is usually more subjective in nature and can sometimes lead you away from the original creative intent of your work.",
