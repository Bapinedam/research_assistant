    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I mostly use AI for brainstorming, e.g. feeding it my ideas on a question and asking if I missed any obvious issues. It'll then tend to list 5 or so things and maybe 1 is actually on the right track and the rest are nonsense. A teacher I trust the feedback much more and am less skeptical of.\n\nI also occassionally feed it code with errors to see what it suggests the cause of an error is, and it's useful for that very basic level of feedback to spot typos or syntax errors or bad implementations. I wouldn't really trust it's code on it's own though.",
