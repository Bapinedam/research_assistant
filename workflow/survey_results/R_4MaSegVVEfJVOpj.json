    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI can only go so far and don't know about how i have performed in other assignments, in class or what i personally/academically struggle with. Teacher feedback is much more personalised and they understand most if not all nuance to my writing and can ask questions as to why i have made certain choices, being able to deliberate with me.",
