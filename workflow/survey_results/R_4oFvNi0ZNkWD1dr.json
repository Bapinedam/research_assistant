    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I found that I learn more from being able to ask questions without fear of judgement when I use AI. I also find that teachers don't always have the time to answer all of your questions so AI has been helpful as I can delve deeper into a topic and ask questions about things that I don't understand and it will simplify the answers when I ask it to so that it makes sense to me. I then don't have to be the 'annoying student' who has to ask questions about something the teacher has already explained because I don't understand the way the teacher has explained the topic. It has also helped me to improve my writing fluency and vocabulary when completing assignments and I don't feel as stressed because I don't have to spend so much time editing and re-writing assignment over and over as AI is able to help with this and university teachers are not available to help you to improve your assignment writing ability.",

    "Response": "It was really helpful to reflect on what I have and have not found helpful. I feel grateful that we have this technology available to us as I found that I was a lot more stressed in my undergraduate degree when this technology did not exist. I feel like I have learnt more being able to spend time exploring where I can improve instead of being provided very general and basic feedback from my teacher that feels rushed and like I'm wasting their time.",
