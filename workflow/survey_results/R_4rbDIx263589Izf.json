    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI cannot really be trusted and only provides feedback to a certain function or aspect you have typed into (gotten it to actually do). Whereas a teacher or university lecturer providing feedback is more applicable as they have a better understanding of the task and best improvements to make if needed. It is also more trustworthy.",
