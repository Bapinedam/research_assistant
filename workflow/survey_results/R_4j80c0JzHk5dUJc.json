    "Response": "It's good for showing glaring mistakes you may have missed (15 hours at a laptop, and you miss things), however, gpt is not there yet. You'd be a fool to trust anything it gives you, but it is good to give you ideas on how (and where) to look at things",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "No, because it's shit feedback. It is not as critical as I want it to be, and therefore,  not really helpful- except for those glaring mistakes I mentioned earlier.",

    "Response": "There's no comparison. The nuanced feedback from a teacher is essential to honing and refining skillets. Ai is like a high-school student in comparison. Theres no real insight.. Give it a few years though.",
