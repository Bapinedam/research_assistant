    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is a very quick and easy way to get ideas or feedback, it is instant and there is no shame in telling/asking it whatever you want, or even asking for clarification on the same idea several times. GenAI can be good for this, but I find it is best used in a sort of \"rubber-ducky\" way, bouncing my own ideas off of it and having a conversation with myself, really only relying on GPT to tell me if my ideas are obviously factually wrong.\n\nThis is because I consider GPT to be very untrustworthy. Again, I feel as though it is a good tool in certain situations, especially with how instantaneous it is, and how much attention it can give you, but in terms of factual correctness, and how confident I feel in the information it gives me, especially with mnore technical and obscure subjects a real tutor can't be beat.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My teachers feedback is much more meaningful than GenAI's because I know that GenAI is prompted to provide very docile and agreeable responses, and that it also doesn't really know the criteria or the information. I find GPT to be very suggestible, that I can even change its mind if it disagrees with me about a fact, which makes me much less likely to believe what it is saying, or think that its feedback is honest and meaningful.",

    "Response": "Teachers can be harder to get ahold of, and I often feel bad asking for too much clarification, or taking up too much time, but their feedback is much more meaningful and often correct than that of GenAI.",
