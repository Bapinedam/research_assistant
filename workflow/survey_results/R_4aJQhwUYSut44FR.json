    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I honestly think the feedback from GenAI has been more tailored to me. Sometimes it seems like the marker/teacher hasn't had a lot of time to give useful and helpful feedback which I feel like impacts my ability to learn from my mistakes and improve in future assignments.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Not necessarily how I felt, but sometimes marker/teacher feedback can feel rushed and doesn't always have a great amount of detail. That can be frustrating when I feel like I deserve more as a student.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI is generally just easier to gain instant feedback. No need to wait for teachers to email back or to say they are unable to answer questions due to constraints of the assignment.",
