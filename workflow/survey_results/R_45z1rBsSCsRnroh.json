    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Scared to put my work through AI in case my final assignment is put through an AI checker post-submission. I'm worried my work will say it's written by AI if AI claims the rights to the work i submitted into its platform.\n\nAlso don't know how to provide the rubric and instructions into AI so that it can provide accurate and appropriate feedback.",
