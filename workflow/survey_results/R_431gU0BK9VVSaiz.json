    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "i used AI to break down rubrics for me and provide examples of what the requirements should look like so i have some idea of how i should frame or structure my work. I also ask AI how my work compares to the rubrics to see if im on the right track. Comparing this to teachers who struggle to explain the rubric past the exact wording that is used doesnt actually help me a lot so i think AI has impacted my learning by being able to give me more direction based off the wording provided.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI usually tells you what youve done right or well compared to teachers who tend to focus only on what you have done wrong which can leave a negative impact on your mental state as you are then also forced to focus on the negatives and struggle to see what was good with your work.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teachers are usually more picky which is understandable but i feel they pull things you should have done out of no one (as in it wasnt specifically asked for in the explanation of the assignment or the rurbic) which i feel is a little unfair as youre being told youre marked against the words in front of you on the rubric yet they expect you to go off track of that. Whereas AI keeps the marking against the rubric to a tea which is how i believe it should be.",
