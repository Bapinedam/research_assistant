    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I don't necessarily use it often, but it sometimes will generate \"feedback\" which is just wrong. It's also a lot of the time not wholly relevant. Teachers for example know the marking criteria much better and can give much more targeted and relevant feedback.",
