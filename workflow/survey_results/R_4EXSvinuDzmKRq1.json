    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "teachers tend to give you feedback in a very specific way that applies to you, and their knowledge of the coarse helps with that, cause they know what areas are of most importance. AI tends to give a wide variety of feedback, even ones that wouldn't necessarily apply to your unit, its nice to get perspective but effective concise feedback is sharp and straight to the point.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback usually feels better, AI feedback is great for asking further questions, as the AI does not have any downtime, you can ask it additional questions at any further date and get more feedback.",
