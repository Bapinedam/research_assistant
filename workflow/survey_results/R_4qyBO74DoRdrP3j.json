    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI has been a great way to get extra tips/feedback on my assessments or study material. Though, its less reliable for factual details. The impact of it has been thats its much quicker and easier to get direct feedback. \n\nA teacher is more reliable and I can rely on them more for factual information, though timeliness is not as great as AI as uni teachers are not always available and it can take some time to hear back from them.",
