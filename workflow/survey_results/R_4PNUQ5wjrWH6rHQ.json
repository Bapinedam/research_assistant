    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I'm struggling to think of a time in my degree when any tutors have even given useful feedback, usually it's provided after the assessment has been submitted and even then it's often not been helpful. But then I don't really go to GenAI for too much feedback either, but when I get stuck with code it can be helpful in explaining what the code is doing or helping me debug it.",

    "Response": "A tutor giving unhelpful or confusing feedback feels way worse than GenAI giving you confusing or unhelpful feedback, because my expectations for GenAI aren't very high.",
