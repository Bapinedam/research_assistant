    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from a teacher is often of higher quality, however GenAI is able to provide instant feedback and allows for iterative improvements and constant feedback. When it is provided with a marking criteria and given a comprehensive instruction, it is able to provide excellent feedback. It can also be refined over a few messages by asking it to give new feedback but changing x about it to be more accurate or helpful",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from a teacher is often more honest and makes me feel more confident when it is positive, however many GenAI models are trained to be more positive so I am not always as comforted by it",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teachers are often providing feedback for many students so they can sometimes miss small details, however GenAI is less likely to miss small things and is also more likely to suggest ways of improving mistakes or shortcommings",
