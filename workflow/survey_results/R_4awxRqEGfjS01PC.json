    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I am able to take control of my learning more, as I can create specific GPTs within ChatGPT for each subject which uses the subject textbook as the basis of its knowledge and can teach me, quiz me and refine my skills.\n\nTeachers especially within the university setting do not have the ability to do all of those things. Most times the lecture videos become to dull to watch by week 5 and hence I feel more interactive using other ways",
