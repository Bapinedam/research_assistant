    "Response": "teachers/ educators at university seem rather incompetent regarding their ability to give constructive and clear feedback which can be applied to future assessment and learning. AI, however, is very clear and specific to the assignment and objectives.",

    "Response": "I feel a lot more supported and understood, ironically, by the AI software as it actually considers how people will understand and apply the feedback. My teacher's have never actually given useful and comprehensive feedback, leading me to question what I am paying for. I may as well as enrol in an online course, as it would be more effective",
