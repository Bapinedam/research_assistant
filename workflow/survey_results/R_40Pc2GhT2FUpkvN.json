    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I approach anything generated by AI with some level of scrutiny and so I always double check with the course profile/lecture notes or coordinator/lecturers/textbook\n\nI always feel that I take away more using AI because it has 24/7 accessibility and I can ask for specific points to be expounded upon until I reach a level of understanding I feel comfortable with.  Teacher's aren't available 24/7, they have lives and responsibilites (rightly so), and asking them to explain a point further and further and further into increasing detail or deconstructing it down to the bones isn't possible - they don't have the time, and more importantly sometimes the way a teacher explains something just doesn't suit the way I learn. \n\nI have spent hours upon hours rewatching lecture in hopes of miraculously understanding. It feels so out of my grasp at times because the lecturer just doesn't teach in a way that I can take in. I taught myself everything using AI with guidance from lecture notes regarding accuracy and reliability regarding content and concepts, if I hadn't done this I don't believe I would have received a pass in some of my courses. With AI I have bee able to achieve distinctions because I am able to flesh out concepts and thoughts and tailor responses to my individual learning needs.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I feel uncomfortable approaching teachers because I always feel that they don't have the time to talk to me - body language and social cues. I too feel mentally 'slow' when I ask a teacher to clarify something or reword something, I am always left feeling as though my teachers are exasperated at the interaction. \n\nUsing AI I feel safe and able to ask any question at all without judgement or distraction from body language and social cues.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I do still love talking to my teachers because I love people, and it's really engaging to bounce ideas back and forth and feed off of each others energy and conversation. The human aspect enables ideas or explanations that I hadn't thought of to be brought up and sometimes that can be just as helpful as digging really deep into a topic using AI and a lot quicker also",
