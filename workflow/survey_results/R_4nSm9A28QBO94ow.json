    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It is much faster to get feedback from GenAI rather than teachers at university as teachers often have a heavy workload. This isn't to say that I won't turn to my teachers but it's convenient when I need to get feedback fast, it's available. My difficulty is that I am constantly prompting GenAI to not rewrite my work as I want feedback without subconsciously incorporating generated work.",
