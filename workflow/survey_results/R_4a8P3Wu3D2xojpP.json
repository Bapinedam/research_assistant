    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI offers instant, personalized feedback, which is great for quick learning, but lacks the depth and emotional support a teacher provides. Teachers help with critical thinking and provide tailored guidance based on individual needs.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI feels neutral and efficient, but impersonal. In contrast, feedback from a teacher is more encouraging and supportive, making it feel more meaningful and motivating.",
