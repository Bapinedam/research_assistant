    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I have a lot more distrust in AI as it does not know the full picture. I'm also aware that it can generate false information which causes more scepticism for me. My teacher however is aware of all aspects of the subject and materials and will be a much more reliable source to get answers on questions or feedback.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI gives me ideas, but for the most part I disregard most of it as I mentioned I have a lot of distrust in its accuracy. Teacher feedback I look at more carefully, and whilst it can be vague it is more reassuring to understand areas I need to work. I trust it much more.",
