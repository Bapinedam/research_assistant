    "Response": "GenAI Can provide personalized responses and adapt to individual learning styles and paces. It can offer tailored feedback and resources based on the specific needs of the student.\n  Teacherï¼š Personalization is also possible, but it may be limited by class size and the need to address the needs of multiple students simultaneously.\n\nGenAI Available 24/7, providing instant responses and support whenever needed, which is particularly useful for self-paced learning.\n Teacher Available during class times and office hours. Real-time assistance might not be as readily available outside these times.\n\n GenAI Can provide detailed explanations and access to vast amounts of information. However, it may lack the ability to detect subtle misunderstandings and address them effectively.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI made me feel more autonomous and flexible because I could get answers at any time. However, it sometimes lacked a personal touch and individualized support. On the other hand, feedback from my teacher was usually warmer and more tailored, making me feel cared for and supported, although it sometimes required waiting.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI is very fast and can provide a wealth of information and resources, but it lacks in-depth understanding and emotional support. Teacher feedback is more specific and thorough, offering more background knowledge and experience sharing, and face-to-face interaction helps better understand my confusion.",
