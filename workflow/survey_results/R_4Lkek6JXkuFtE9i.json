    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I can get the feedback from GenAI fairly quickly and go on with my study. But if I contact a teacher for help via email, I expect to wait for 2-3 days for the response. So nowadays, I try to ask the GenAI first. If I still cannot figure out the problem, I'll then contact my teacher.",
