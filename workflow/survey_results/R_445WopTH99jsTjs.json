    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The kind of help I've received from each of these sources varied in content. GenAI helped me decode more complex topics and find examples to help better understand the theories discussed in class. This helped me have better conversations with teachers about more specific questions related to my work.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI responses are quire objective and left me feeling satisfied in the way I could ask endless questions to clear different aspects about my doubts. With teachers, the approach was more subjective and tailored to what they knew about me and my work in general. Both played off of each other to make my work more comprehensive yet original.",
