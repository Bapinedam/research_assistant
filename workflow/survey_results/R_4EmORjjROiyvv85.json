  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI, I'm more wary of the feedback, ensuring I'm reading through to look for mistakes, while with a teacher's feedback, I'm more confident that they probably haven't glossed over or made obvious mistakes. I am aware though that teachers probably didn't have much time to look at the work, so there is also that wariness to it.",
