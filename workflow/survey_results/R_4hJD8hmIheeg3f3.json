    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I prefer to proofread and edit my own work, or peer-edit. I like the process and don't find it particularly difficult, and I get more out of self-editing then using AI for feedback. I've also found that AI doesn't do very well providing feedback on theoretical essays for niche, ultra-specific topics, which is most of my workload .",
