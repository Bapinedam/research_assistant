    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Our lecturers don't always have the time to spare in giving each and every one of us feedback, and our TA's and people who mark our assignments sometimes give us no feedback at all, let alone good feedback.\n\nGenAI is a means to check myself to identify any points I missed at my own discretion, in my own time, on demand.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feelings don't matter. I'm here to in university to become good at what I do and in my field, not feel good while being terrible at my job.\n\nSometimes human teaching staff try so hard to be nice and offer no constructive criticism or feedback. they are objectively useless in that regard. GenAI is better.",

    "Response": "GenAI is capable of giving purely objective, truthful and indepth feedback while human teaching staff often cut corners as they have a lot of work and not enough time or incentive.",
