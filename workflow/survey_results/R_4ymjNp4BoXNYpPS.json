    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I think its nice to have feedback on your learning outside those who are actually marking you. Having someone (or rather something) to bounce off, and ask to break things down into really simple terms or test your understanding improves my learning so that I can build foundations to ask more deep and critical questions on content with my teacher",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI, there is very little judgment. I feel when I seek feedback from tertiary practitioners there is a lot of judgment as to your learning level. When you work and study full-time, plus have extra curricular achievements it can be very difficult to keep on track of course work, however when I seek clarification from the teacher, there is often a feeling of failure in your commitment for not being across the basics, preparing all the lecture content etc. You often can't ask them to read your writing either, whether Gen AI will do this and apply a positive tone.",
