    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI (grammarly is what I use) was able to be specific and show me areas where I could improve, and so I was able to learn and implement those changes in my current and future work. Feedback from teachers is often general, nonspecific, and often only for the task that has already been completed, and not transferable. This is, I believe, in part due to Monash's ridiculously short time periods allocated to marking, reducing the time tutors can give for accurate and helpful feedback.",
