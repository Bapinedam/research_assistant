    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My teacher didn't provide detailed feedback and it was quite generic compared to the feedback that GenAI provided me. This impacted my learning as with feedback I was able to tailor my responses to improve, but due to it being from GenAI I was unsure how trustworthy it would be as my teacher is the one who marks my results in the end.",
