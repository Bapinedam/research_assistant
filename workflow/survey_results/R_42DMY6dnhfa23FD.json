    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "As mentioned earlier, I find it interesting that I can ask as many questions as I want to AI and it removes the shame in asking for help - this results in positive outcomes for learning - because I believe using it to actually learn can be useful.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My teacher has a job to teach me so there is that level of sincerity they have, where they try their best- that and because they are marking the assigment/work I can rely on their answers. However, teachers are often stressed and live complicated lives making me feel like a burden when I ask for help- whereas AI is much more forgiving when I ask a very simple question (eg long division) over and over.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "AI is alot more structures in its feedback, and I can ask for it how I want it - albeit steps, or in a table or in paragraphs. I can ask it to expand on certain points and summarize others. Whereas I cannot explicitly instruct teachers for this output, I acknowledge that their experience in the industry means their answers already resemble this.",
