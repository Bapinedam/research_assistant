    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is instant, so I can get that answer immediately if I have a minor question. I can modify its answer to be simpler and easier to understand, which some teachers cannot do for complex topics. I usually go to my teacher/coordinator for more complex questions for which I would not use AI, and have the time to wait for a response.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Recently, answers from my teacher/coordinator have left me more confused and going with my gut at the end of the day, leaving me frustrated because I want to do everything I can to get good marks.\nWhen using GenAI, it can give me feedback on an assignment (which is kinda annoying) but in the end the edited version of my assignment flows way better and in general, I understand the assignment a lot more before I used GenAI to get feedback.",
