    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because for the work where I'm already using GenAI, there's not a need to use GenAI to check GenAI as the GenAI should provide the right answer already. For work where I don't need to use GenAI, I'm usually confident in my ability to answer the question/write well.",
