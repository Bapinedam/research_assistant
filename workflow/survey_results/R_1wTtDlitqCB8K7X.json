    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "The feedback of GenAI is trained by the content from other users, including me as a setting logic under their code. I am not trust their professional in a specific aspect such as my major. Meanwhile, I mostly use AI to brainstorming and plan my weekly receipts, which made the feedback not that worthy. When I need to create content, such as a paragraph, I would provide a very detailed instruction first, which already kind of completed, in which case the feedback could only be a suggestion.",
