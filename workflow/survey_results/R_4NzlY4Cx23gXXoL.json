    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI didn't really understand the marking criteria, especially compared to my teachers. It couldn't mark a lot of work at once (e.g., if I put in my whole essay it struggled to mark it). The predicted marks were much different than the marks I recieved.  However AI was really good when I provided short examples. (e.g., \"tell me if this paragraph matches this criteria).",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Not really. GenAI made me confused. I guess sometimes teachers can be a bit harsh but it doesn't bother me if the feedback is constructive.",

    "Response": "They were usually very different. For example, AI would tell me to be more consicse on a point while my teacher would tell me to expand.",
