    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers most of the time gives great feedback for my study. But, it's hard sometimes to reach out to them ask I have to attend consultation sessions or wait for my email to be reply with. But with the use of AI, I get my questions answer right away with a high credibility and I can even modify it to be suit my understanding.",
