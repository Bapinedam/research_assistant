    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GAI is very useful for getting feedback on language used but when used to check mathematical models or code it can be unreliable and inaccurate. Teaching staff are far less available than GAI (for obvious reasons) but are also far more reliable.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GAI is very sweet in the way it responds to your questions and cannot be 'frustrated' like a teacher may be. However, GAI is very self directed and cannot replace the depth of understanding a field expert has, which makes it more isolating and less comforting.",
