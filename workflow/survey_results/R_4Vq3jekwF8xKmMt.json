    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI can give helpful feedback, but I think it is more from a general perspective and in a very superficial manner. For specific and personalized feedback, only a teacher can give. Sometimes I use GenAI to improve the flow of the paragraph. This way, I understand whether my text is clear and say what I want to say before I send it to my advisor. This is helpful because my advisor can then focus on giving feedback on the content without the trouble of first trying to understand what I want to say.",
