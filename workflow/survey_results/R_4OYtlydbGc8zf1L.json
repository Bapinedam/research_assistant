    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I wasn't aware it could provide feedback on things like whole essays, which are what most of my assignments are. I don't use it for feedback more for when I'm stuck on an idea or need inspiration to read and build off. Also mainly for summarising or paraphrasing sentences.",
