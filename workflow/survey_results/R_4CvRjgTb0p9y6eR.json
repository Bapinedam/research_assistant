    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Sometimes the GenAI does not understand what I want to resolve, or there is something vague that I have not expressed clearly. Our Teacher, on the other hand, can easily find your mistakes or issues that cause you confusion. However, we cannot ignore the fact that our teachers are also human, which means they need rest and relaxation. When I use AI tools to help me solve problems or work, there's no time limit.",
