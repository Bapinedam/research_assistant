    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI can help in explaining the text, which we did not understand in more detail and in easy words, and can guide us. But GenAI is not teacher, Whatever GenAI says is sometimes true, But What teacher says, is always true and related to our studies. GenAI give general answer, but teacher gives answer related to our subject. Basically, GenAI does not impact my learning, because I trust teacher more than GenAI, and I know whatever teacher teaches us is best.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI give feedback based on some algorithms, Keywords and like wise. For example, my assessment has some requirements, and it has some important keywords like my assessment should include introduction, conclusion. So, GenAI see those keywords and check if my assessment has those keyword or not. On other hand, the teacher, see inside the introduction and conclusion, and give feedback like introduction should include the structure of the report. So, that thing make a difference here. I feel, getting feedback from GenAI is sometimes okay, but feedback of teacher means a lot.",
