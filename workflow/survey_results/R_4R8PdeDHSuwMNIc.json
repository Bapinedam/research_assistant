    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I believe it is not appropriate to do so, and using GENAI means it is academic dishonesty. Additionally, even those GenAI were recommended or allowed to be used in students' assessments; it is still not advance enough to give researchers appropriate or high-quality sources. I think those tools usually do not give enough credit to the sources or other researchers due to their inability to produce accurate citations, for example, creating AGLC4 citation to the information that it generated.",
