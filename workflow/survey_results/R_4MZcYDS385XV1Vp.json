    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GENAI' s generated materials are often used as a tutorial for course. Sometimes the textbook cases are very old and the explanation of a concept is unclear. I went back to ask GenAI because the teacher cannot keep up with the latest trends. But the academic text of the exam content and concepts, the teacher's answers are more official.",
