    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It made me feel more comfortable asking a stranger like GenAI for advice and feedback on my studies. Some teachers will help students from time to time in a friendly manner. It just feels easier asking GenAI than a teacher if feedback takes time and may make me afraid of the feedback's result.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI gives you brainstorming ideas that are more creative than your own. However, the feedback I received from my teachers in the past provided little or no helpful solutions, making it more challenging to complete an assignment or assessment.",
