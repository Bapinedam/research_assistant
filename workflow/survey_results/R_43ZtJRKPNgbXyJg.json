    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My teacher is more likely to give feedback relevant to the marking criteria and the specific course. GenAI is sometimes a little vague or different from the course but feels less effort as you don't have to bother your teacher with questions.",

    "Response": "Feedback from teacher feels more genuine and better if they say you're doing well. GenAI feels less trustworthy, I'm a lot more likely to ignore what it says or get annoyed if I don't think it's correct.",
