    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The immediate feedback from GenAI is invaluable for improving my work and understanding. Whilst teaching staff are undoubtedly more valuable than any GenAI tool, their time is unfortunately scarce and not reliable.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback is a lot more detailed and in-depth (and additionally, is interactive in that you can clarify or debate certain points of feedback). This often leaves me feeling more confident in my work when compared to TA feedback which tends to be more binary and short.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Oftentimes TA feedback is so short that I don't think it can even be considered feedback. This is not a criticism of the TAs themselves, but rather the increasing student:staff ratios and budget cuts seen around faculties and universities in Australia, resulting in less individual engagement for students. Given this trend I think it is only natural that a majority of students would therefore lean on GenAI tools to fill in the gap.",
