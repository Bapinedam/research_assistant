    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "It seems the critical analyses of GenAI still leaves much to be desired  i.e. It's excessively positive, and we need to expose imprecise/inaccurate weaknesses in novel circumstances so as an AI has to build understanding discretely, there is always a biological advantage in sensory perception and hence expression that a human body holds separate fields of knowledge/experience as relevant to the unknown in an emotive style. That is the crux of a helpful feedback and one a digital consciousness alone cannot, at least presently, possess.",
