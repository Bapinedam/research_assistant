  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The influence of a teacher comes more from their experience, while AI relies more on big data. A teacher might provide guidance on major academic decisions, such as how to plan the studies for the semester, whereas AI is more suitable for answering daily, routine questions.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "A teacher's response usually aligns better with my situation because it is based on feedback received after a period of communication. However, AI might just choose the most common answer, which raises doubts about its reliability.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Of course, a teacher's experience can also be flawed, but it includes their own reasoning and thought process. On the other hand, if you don't provide AI with complete information, it may still give you answers that seem obviously incorrect and could repeatedly make the same mistakes.",
