    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Generative AI cannot provide meaningful feedback. It is a language model designed to espouse the most satisfactory answer based on the user interaction. It is not capable of dissecting layers of meaning, intent, and academic nuances in a single body of work. Generative AI serves to address the needs of the masses and cannot meaningfully engage in any one piece of work simply because it is a generation machine, not an academic.",
