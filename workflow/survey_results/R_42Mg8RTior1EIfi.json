    "Response": "When I dont understand something even if its a super simple concept, Ive asked repeatedly to make it easier for me to understand and AI just does it quick and simple, without judgement and straight to the point. I dont have to deal with weird interactions from other people.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Absolutely. I can ask even the easiest and more basic concepts with NO judgement. The teachers have an amount of time to give the class or practice. With AI there's no need to rush anything, theres full availability from me and no bias. Somehow makes you feel safe to ask and go to your own rhythm",
