    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI lets me ask questions ad nauseum. The teacher doesn’t. The barrier to entry of talking to a teacher to get feedback is orders of magnitudes higher than asking AI. Also, the AI simply knows more, especially if using a custom GPT or NotebookLLM, or similar ‘configurable’ LLMs where you can input your own documents, and it parses them in addition to its entire knowledge base.",
