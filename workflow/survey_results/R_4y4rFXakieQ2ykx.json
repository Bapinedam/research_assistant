    "Response": "Feedback from teacher was limited to few general points but it gives a perspective on what they expect for a particular assignment. \nFeedback from AI was precise as I could ask as many questions as I want and dig deeper with my own space and time. Giving me my freedom to explore deeper into feedback without time restrictions we might have with faculties.",
