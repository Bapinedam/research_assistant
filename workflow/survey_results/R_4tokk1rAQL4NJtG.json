    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Its immediate - i dont need to wait for my supervisor\nit saves me lots of time as it influences my choices and direction in creating my own content so that it helps me to maximize my time with supervisor as my work is more thought through and developed. GenAI does things my supervisor cannot do or always do or does not have time to do such as give me a summary of a resource or suggestions for a better way of phrasing my content or suggestions for academic resources to read.",
