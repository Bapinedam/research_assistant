    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I just prefer the specificity of genAI feedback cause it feels very tailored to my work. for feedback from my teacher, if i want to inquire further its a long process of having to find the email address for the unit, then i have to write an email in a professional way whilst i feel more comfortable with genAI as i can just ask exactly what i wanna know abt the feedback.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
