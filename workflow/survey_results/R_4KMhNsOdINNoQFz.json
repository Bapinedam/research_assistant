    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I believe most of the time the response for a feedback would always be positive no matter if it deserves a good feedback or not. If not, It then enhances its feedback response to a positive one once you ask it what specifically is wrong with the text. The feedback has never been something I could use and rely GenAI for.",
