    "Response": "GenAI feedback encourages me to use my own thinking and ideas to take its suggestions and improve my work myself. My teacher doesn't quite do this, especially in my uni studies (in comparison to high school studies).",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My teachers make me feel more understood in what I came up with myself, however, feedback isn't always specific and harder to take from than GenAI, which makes me feel like I have a clear direction into reworking my work.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Sometimes GenAI will give feedback that just doesn't suit, and adjusting the prompt you give GenAI doesn't always work. This doesn't happen with teachers - they will give feedback that fits critera.",
