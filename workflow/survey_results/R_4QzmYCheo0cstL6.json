    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The GenAI creates contextless summarised information which is actually pretty hard to comprehend. However, it also has the capability to delineate in a story-like way. Therefore, it can recreate a story frame work for the requested input. Therefore, it transforms some of the old study into more modern versions leading a better comprehensions.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers tend to know their field better and more personal. They don't only provide feedback based on the information that you have showed them, they also provide feedback on the things you haven't show. It is a personalised and biased feedback for sure, but it stimulates the student better than GenAIs do.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI doesn't feel like a particular persona with a structured worldview, instead, it feels like a machine, resulting in very isolated and abstract UX.",
