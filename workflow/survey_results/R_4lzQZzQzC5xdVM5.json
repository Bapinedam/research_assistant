    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "teachers offer more personalized feedback and can help students understand concepts at a deeper level. While AI can be helpful for grammar and factual accuracy, it can’t replace a teacher’s ability to provide guidance and challenge students to think critically.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "students might feel encouraged by positive feedback from both GenAI and a teacher, motivated to improve based on constructive criticism, frustrated if they receive negative feedback from GenAI, or reassured by a teacher's feedback if they're unsure about their work. Ultimately, the emotional impact of feedback will depend on the individual student's personality, mindset, and the specific nature of the feedback.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback is more immediate and objective, focusing primarily on technical aspects like grammar and style. A teacher's feedback, on the other hand, could be more personalized and subjective, considering factors like the student's overall understanding of the topic and their ability to think critically. Additionally, a teacher might provide broader context or offer alternative perspectives that GenAI might not be able to generate.",
