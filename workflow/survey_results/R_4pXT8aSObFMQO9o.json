    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because the GenAI feedback is not 100% accurate about what I have done in my studies and assignments, I understand that because for some subjects the GenAI is still not giving correct results. From my practical experience, I have done research on my answers, however, it doesn't provide accurate results since the GenAI has not matured yet as I assumed.",
