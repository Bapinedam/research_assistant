    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I rely more on interactive feedbacks from a person rather than AI. Mainly because I believe AI lack of the knowledge of the main focus in my units and criteria check. AI is great but they also give the most general idea rather than specifically on what I have to work on. So a tutor's feedback would work the best for me in this case.",
