    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The Ai that I have used in the past was a couple years old, therefore didn't have enough relevant information to critically analyse my work properly, whereas my teacher/tutor was able to give 'human' feedback on what they are/were looking for, what specific parts could be updated and/or changed, and what needs to be looked into further/expanded on.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Sometimes the feedback I was given from teachers/tutors was given in a round-about way, not specifically addressing the thing I wanted feedback on, whereas if I asked Ai a specific question, whether it was relevant information or not, it would give specific feedback on what I wanted. (Ignoring that most of the time it was not correct information due to the differences in assignment guidelines around the country.",
