    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "while GenAI can enhance learning through personalized and immediate support, it lacks the depth, emotional connection, and nuanced understanding that a teacher brings to the educational experience. Combining both tools might offer a balanced approach to maximize learning outcomes.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "from a teacher generally feels more personal, supportive, and emotionally resonant compared to the more neutral and mechanical feedback from GenAI. The human element in teaching provides a layer of emotional support and encouragement that can be crucial for student motivation and overall well-being.",
