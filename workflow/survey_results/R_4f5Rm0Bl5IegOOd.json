    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI criticism and suggestions are usually easier to take, sometimes I really take to heart any negative or constructive comments made my teachers because I’ve always been someone who wants to please my teachers/prove to them that I am intelligent. But because also it’s feedback that I received after it’s submitted, it’s different to hearing feedback that you can use before you’re marked.",
