    "Response": "Well genAI feedback is available anytime I need it which is convenient. On the other hand, teachers are real people and can't give me immediate feedback whenever i need it.\nHowever, teachers give me better feedback because they have context to your work while you have to explain the context to the genAI and sometimes it gets it wrong.",
