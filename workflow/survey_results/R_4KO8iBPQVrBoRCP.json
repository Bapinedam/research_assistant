    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I am weary of using AI, I haven't used it enough to know much about it. I want to keep my work my own, so that the feedback I get from my markers is feedback on my own work, my own understandings and progress throughout the course. I wouldn't think AI could give me feedback relevant enough to my course content and unit outcomes. I trust my markers to provide me with the necessary feedback to progress my learning.",
