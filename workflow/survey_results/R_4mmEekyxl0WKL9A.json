    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I have found that feedback across different units has varied sometimes, especially because I study across three different disciplines within my degree, each with slightly different conventions (Criminology, Literature, Philosophy). The feedback GenAI produces may not actually be appropriate for the given task. I also have consistently high achievement across the majority of assignments, so I honestly trust my own judgement more than AI because of this.",
