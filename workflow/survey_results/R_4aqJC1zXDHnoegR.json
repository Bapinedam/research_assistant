  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I could not trust GenAI as much as I could trust my teacher because GenAI does not generally have access to the structure of my curriculum or how assessment tasks should be completed at Monash. That said, I cannot fully trust my teachers either as marking varies from teacher to teacher.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Engaging in the feedback process with a genuine human definitely has a more motivating effect. However, as feedback procedures are moving online and becoming standardised for the sake of fairness, GenAI is looking to be less of a disadvantaged alternative.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI tends to be influenced more by the prompt than the actual work that is presented to it. This means that it can be influenced by one's own opinion of their work.",
