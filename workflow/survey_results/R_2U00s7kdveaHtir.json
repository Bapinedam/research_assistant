    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I chose not to use GenAI for feedback on my work because, as a design student, I value personalized critiques from instructors and peers who understand the context and nuances of my projects. Human feedback allows for more nuanced and specific insights, which are essential for refining my creative ideas and aligning them with my design goals.",
