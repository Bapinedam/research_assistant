    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Generative AI is only useful if you already know what output you're after, and have the skills & knowledge to verify it. In essence, it's little more than a tool to save time and energy.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback that seems poorly justified or explained is frustrating to receive, whereas similar GenAI feedback is much easier to mentally discard. Similarly, praise from GenAI feels completely hollow, whereas praise from a teacher feels much more validating.",

    "Response": "GenAI is extremely likely to change its output in order to please the user - and thus, n the context of giving feedback, will frequently retract its criticisms if you challenge them in any way.",
