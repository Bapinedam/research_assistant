    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Being in a university where some of my subjects have 500+ people in lectures, I find it difficult to contact my teacher and receive personalized feedback (cumulative effect where assignments are mainly online/multiple choice where I don't access correct answers upon completion). AI is useful in addressing where I could expand my points, or suggest further ideas or points to add. AI also affects my learning in the sense that I feel like I'm \"cheating,\" or in other words, I know I should go to my teacher for feedback but it's easier and quicker for AI to provide real-time feedback, despite the information coming from a computer rather than an actual brain trained in a specific field.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Feedback from teacher felt distant and provided through an \"overall class\" mark, and where the majority went wrong. AI can personalise feedback to what I write which is more useful in correcting work.",

    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from teacher feels more interpersonal (despite a lack of it), whereas feedback from AI, whilst highly relevant to me, tends to provoke a sense of extraterrestrialism.",
