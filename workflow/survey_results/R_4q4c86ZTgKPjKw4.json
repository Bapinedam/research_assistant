    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When I took feedback from AI, I still sometime shad to ask my teacher to reconfirm, but not vice-versa. I look at my teachers as a primary source of information that I can trust, I only use AI to get ideas or brainstorm, but that does not go into my assignments.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I felt more confident and in-touch with my teaching team, when I interact and this improves my learning experience. With AI, it's just a quick help to start my mind before I actually start an assignment.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Gen AI is very American, so sometimes I have to look out for that if it's relevant to my topic, like I once was brainstorming about a Christmas project and AI gave me a very winter theme but that's clearly not for Australia. With Gen AI I am always worried about the source, and how much of it is actually trustworthy, but I don't have to double check like this with my teacher.",
