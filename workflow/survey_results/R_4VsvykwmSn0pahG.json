    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I have access to student services for that. It's about dialoguing with the other person on what I'm trying to convey in my essay which in turn inspires ideas. Doing this with an AI would be erroneous and somewhat dry and sterile, I think. I've never actually thought to do it. I'll try it next time I write an essay, but I wouldn't overly trust it's ability despite paying for it.",
