    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher questions are more engaging and more practical; Due to confidential issues, the AI do not have experience in real life, so it is not helpful in generating a case study or differential diagnoses(gen AIs are not competent in critical thinking and accessing data, especially to those data and info need subscription, e.g. legislation, APF, eTG, eMMINS....) \n\nGen AI provides more sentence starters for me to use. It greatly improved my patient-centred care.",
