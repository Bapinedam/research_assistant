  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI feedback often relies on the context provided within the conversation, but it might not fully grasp the nuances of my learning style, preferences, or classroom expectations. Teacher feedback, on the other hand, is based on a deeper understanding of my personal progress, past work, and classroom interactions.",
