    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI was more helpful when time was a factor, because the feedback was instantaneous. This made my learning less stressful, as I could find the information I needed quickly.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The feedback from my teacher made me feel confused at times when the feedback  that the writing could have been more clear was not accompanied by examples on how this could be achieved. The feedback from GenAI was less frustrating because if the feedback was unclear, I could ask it for clarification immediately.",
