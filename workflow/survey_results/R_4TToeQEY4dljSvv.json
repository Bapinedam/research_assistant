    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Let’s say for the assignment support, I think teachers are always focusing on the key points, they keep things simple, which is good for me to understand what I exactly need to do. On the other hand, the support for GenAI is more detailed, it can give me a lot of information in few seconds, which is more convenient.",

    "Response": "Teachers will take care of my feelings while giving me feedback, they will give me advice also have some chitchat with me, which make me feels more relaxed. However, GenAI is only an AI tools, it do not have feelings, so it just able to give me feedback by words and nothing else.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Teachers had more past experience of the course, they can give me advice or support based on the pass students’ paper because they know students always failed in which parts. However, GenAI only can give me some samples from the internet.",
