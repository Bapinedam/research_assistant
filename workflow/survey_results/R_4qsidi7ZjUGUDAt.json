    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "It actually had not occurred to me. I don't tend to use GenAI for Education assessments as I am very confident of getting 6/7 without any help. For maths once the assessment is finished using GenAI to check it and give feedback is a GREAT idea, as I am very good at making basic mistakes :-)",
