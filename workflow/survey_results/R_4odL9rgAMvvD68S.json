    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Oftentimes, after AI gives me feedback and I have implemented it to my work, when I run it through the AI again, it would tell me to do something else instead. For example:\nAI: \"You should change the title to ABCD\"\nI change it to ABCD.\nAI: \"You should change the title to ABCE\"\nIt's just not consistent and isn't completely correct most of the time.",
