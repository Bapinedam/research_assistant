    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI presented immediate feedback. The teacher's time is limited and thus it's difficult to get feedback right away. Further, we often only get feedback on assignments, which directly impact our grade and hence often find teacher feedback 'too late' as the assignments are already submitted before feedback can be acted on. GenAI provides immediate feedback, so helpful changes can be made before assignment submission to improve the quality of work.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I generally feel less anxious when receiving GenAI feedback. Potentially as it's coming from a third party/non-human - that emotional connection isn't as strong.",
