    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I don't trust what the AI thinks about what about my work can be improved. I prefer to try and improve my own work, and use AI only to help me along the way in areas which I have already identified I need improving on. Other than that, only feedback from my friends/lecturers I would trust (to an extent).",
