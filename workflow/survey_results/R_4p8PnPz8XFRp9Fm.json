    "Response": "GenAI helps me identify where the flow of my writing is lacking, while my teachers identify errors in the actual content of my writing, and its adherence to assignment criteria.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I don't care either way about what feedback GenAI provides me about my writing, as I trust my instincts more than AI. I only use it when I feel as if my writing isn't flowing correctly but I can't pinpoint why. I definitely care when my teacher gives me feedback. When it's constructive, it is a bit stressful but I feel better having received it. When the feedback is mostly negative without suggestions for improvement, I often feel quite frustrated or upset.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "Feedback from GenAI is typically vague and flatters the user, while feedback from teachers is more harsh. However, feedback from teachers is far more useful as they understand what is required in order to get a good mark on the assignment.",
