    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "In my experience, teachers are able to draw connections across different pieces of work and inspire your growth and development in a way that GenAI cannot. The feedback provided by GenAI is very task specific and more suitable to making incremental improvements to each piece of work, rather than extending overarching skills.",
