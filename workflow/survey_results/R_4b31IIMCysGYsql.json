    "Response": "Tools like AI writing fluency(ie, Grammarly AI) are not attempting or should be in the same category as large language models. \nGrammarly takes pressure and unnecessary stress out, and it merely the update to spell check, with better parlance.\nLarge language models that are not built for purpose (ie, ChatGPT for psych) are not helpful. HOwever, LLMs that are built for purpose (AI for legal) NEED to be taught.\nAI in psych should be being built by industry, for industry, constantly building upon new research.",
