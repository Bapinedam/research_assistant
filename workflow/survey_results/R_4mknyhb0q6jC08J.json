    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "OpenAI is not sharing detailed information on how tools like ChatGPT work, so they may be using something different that is effective. But, as far as I know, LLMs are just stochastic models trying to predict the best next token. They are not logical models and can't do research, so I would not trust them for feedback unless it is my only option.",
