    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Gen AI has been able to provide comprehensive feedback and suggest recommendations for improvements or changes in directions. However, feedback provided from teachers is often very vague, and does not provide any constructive feedback or help on how to improve the work.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is more accessible than teachers, I.e can be accessed whenever. Often teachers can unintentionally or intentionally be condescending, rude and outright unhelpful, often as there is a power imbalance in this relationship between students and teachers. Often resulting in students no engaging in teacher consultations as often it will create negative sentiments about the course as a whole. GenAI is objective in its responses and can provide feedback required for a students’’ individual needs.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI often provides better explanations that are in depth and outline the step necessary to achieve the outcome. It can also reword how the explanation are presented, thus allowing students to better understand the concepts. Teachers are often  unable to provide this content to the same degree of detail, as they typically focus on high level concepts rather than directing students to look in specific  parts.",
