    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When getting feedback on work, a teacher needs to have scheduled discussions or a time delay to get feedback. This can be a constraint when the time is limited. Using GenAI, this issue is easily addressed. However, the feedback received from GenAI must be compared with other resources to ensure the correct feedback is obtained from the tool. Using GenAI is helpful at most of the times.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI sometimes gives a very broad spectrum of answers. This helps me learn certain subjects. It makes me feel knowledgeable. The feedback from the teacher is usually more personalised. Feels more connected to the unit and makes me want to learn more about the unit when that happens.",
