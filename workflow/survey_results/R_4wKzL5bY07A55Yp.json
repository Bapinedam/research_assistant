    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI provided an opportunity to ask numerous follow up questions. Teachers are constrained to time resources.\nThe feedback from my teachers is often focused around answering the questions, (although a good teacher will link it back to real-world uses)\nHowever, as it lacks the accute context of my university degree and assessment, GenAI tends to give feedback encompasing a broader scope.",
