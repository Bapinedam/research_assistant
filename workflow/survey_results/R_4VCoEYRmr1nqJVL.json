    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI gives me more personalised feedback. My teachers seem to sometimes generate a feedback paragraph that seems very generalisable and not personalised to my assessment. So it doesn't really help me to improve or know exactly what I missed and where.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "With AI you can almost have a conversation and pin point the exact part of a writing and ask it questions as to why it would improve that part or another. Whereas a teacher is reachable via email and probably needs to deal with 100s of students at the same time and is not really able to commit to one student and be involved in their learning journey as how I would like it to be.",
