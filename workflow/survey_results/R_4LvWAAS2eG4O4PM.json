    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is very general and tends to not catch technical errors sometimes, even when they're serious.  So it can impact quality of work. But using feedback to improve my written English has been extremely helpful and time-saving. Since feedback from lecturers are usually received after the grade is decided, it doesn't really help with the assignment itself, so it provides more of a learning/ growth opportunity to strive harder for future work",
