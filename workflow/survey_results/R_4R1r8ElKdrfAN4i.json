    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The teacher often gives assessment task-specific feedback, whereas AI is more general., In that case, their feedback is more helpful because the teacher is essentially marking the assessment task.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I use GenAi, specifically ChatGPT because that's the most common AI I use. It has always been incredibly empathetic in how it gives feedback, almost imitating a human, so sadly, I have not found any striking differences, especially in how it makes me feel.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I think the limitation of AI feedback is that it doesn't know the marker, and although its feedback is fair, it can not anticipate the subjective feedback the teacher is bound to provide.",
