    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The AI tends to go into more detail, whereas feedback from teachers is more general and if talked about in lectures, they only speak in issues everyone had (e.g. everyone struggling with a particular question). The feedback is not often personalised and if there is a quiz, for example, there is often no feedback given at all for incorrect questions or it is rather brief so I do not know how to correct these errors. In addition, essay feedback is often brief and shallow. Teacher feedback also doesn't include things we did well or that is suggest we keep for future essays/written questions.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI gave me in depth feedback and was generally more encouraging of making improvements and also describing what I did well, whereas teachers focus on improvements only. I always feel a bit discouraged after reading teacher feedback.",
