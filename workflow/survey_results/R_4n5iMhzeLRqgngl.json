    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Do not see GenAI as functioning according to set rubrics as such while it might be useful in grammatical, punctuation and spelling correction, it might also include content not relevant or beyond scope of an explicit course. Further, a coursera course I completed used it for feedback which I found generic and unhelpful to improving my explicit outcomes. It seems apparent it does not yet get the 'hidden' or secondary meaning of language.",
