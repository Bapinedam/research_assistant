    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI told me how to improve my response, how to make it better align with the question, pointed out areas of improvement and then showed me what a better response could look like. This was really helpful as I could pick and choose which ideas I wanted to implement and grow in my learning. Feedback from teachers is very general, sometimes generic statement with one personalised sentence about why you have lost marks or a simple \"good\" for a response that was appropriate.",

    "Response": "I felt more productive using GenAI as I was able to implement suggestions and grow. Sometimes the feedback from teachers makes me feel confused because its not enough information to know exactly what I missed or what they are expecting in a good response.",
