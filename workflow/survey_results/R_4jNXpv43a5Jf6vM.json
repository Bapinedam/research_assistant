    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I worked as a journalist and staff event organizer, they needed my understanding and creativity to deliver my idea into script and not generated by AI as it would destroy the function of a journalist. The same as an event organizer who connects and communicates with clients, if I use GenAI, I will not learn anything and all my task can be done by AI with robots tone and structures.",
