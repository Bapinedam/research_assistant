    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My answer is based on my whole experience - I have had lecturers who provide exceptional feedback that enabled me to critically engage with my work and to improve it. I have had lecturers who have refused to give feedback or give little to no feedback and this is when I have needed to get \"help\" elsewhere. GenAI is not always accurate - but when I get nothing or little from the University, at least it gives me somewhere to start.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes - GenAI is not supposed to help with my learning - so it is objective and emotionless. I believe that educators should help their students - and so when you get told no - it is subjective and impactful. When lecturers provide you with constructive criticism - I am open to it. I am here to learn.",
