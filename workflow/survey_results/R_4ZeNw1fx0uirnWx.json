    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I honestly don't think it can provide the level of meaningful or actually insightful feedback that I want, at least not currently. I much prefer seeking feedback from tutors, peers and family or even online. The knowledge and lived experience of people is much more useful to me than data parsed through different filters or layers in a GenAI. The times I have tried it in the past, haven't resulted in great feedback, the responses have almost always felt cold and sterile or a bit hollow. I can imagine it getting much greater at this in the future but for the minute, it is definitely lacking.",
