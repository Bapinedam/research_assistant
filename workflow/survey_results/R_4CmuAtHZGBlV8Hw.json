    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "It never occurred to me. I go to university to take advantage of the knowledge of tutors, head coordinators, etc. Considering the price of higher education in Australia, I would be really frustrated if I was ever in a position where I felt that I needed feedback from GenAI, or that said feedback was a substitute for my teachers.",
