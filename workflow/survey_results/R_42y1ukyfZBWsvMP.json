    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "the main difference is teachers understand the context of your work based off of the content from the unit. This is often more specific and tailored to the learning outcomes. AI, on the otherhand, gives feedback that is more general, which can be helpful for making sure writing is cohesive but not always helpful for nuanced perspectives",
