    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is instant and can be used at any time, which saves a lot of time rather than corroborating with students/teachers. I like to use GenAI to give me multiple walkthroughs/analogys for my learning alongside what my teachers provide. I have found it very helpful and in general can provide more ways of understanding the content than just what my teachers provide.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Typically the feedback I recieve is largely typographical and usually has little to do with the actual content of my work. In this regard, GenAI is a much more convienient and quick approach however I trust the feedback much less than what my teachers give directly.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI can and usually does give much more feedback than my teachers do. I can give the AI the prompts/lecture content I am given and it can compare my work directly with the outlines. This allows it to give feedback on each point in the assessment rubric which I have found very useful. Typically the feedback I recieve from teachers is somewhat inconclusive and sometimes doesn't ellaborate on what exactly I needed to do to achieve more marks etc which then requires followup in some regard which further takes more time and effort after the fact.",
