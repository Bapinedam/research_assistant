    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "As most lecturers tend to say more than the required content related to tasks, using GenAI can help me identify the specific parts and areas I need to focus on, without spending time searching through the materials. Mistakes in GenAI can also improve my learning as I am critically thinking and reading the generated content, comparing it to class materials.",
