    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It depends on the type of feedback I'm seeking. AI is useful for reinforcement of content learnt in class. Concepts and definitions that we run through very quickly in class I can revert to AI to help revise. It is also quite good with providing examples etc, but only aspect I am wary of is Chatgpt's unreliability with numbers/figures in calculations. It is fine for more qualitative questions. Other AI engines like copilot I think is possibly more accurate in calcs.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher is always busy and so having AI as a tool/tutor at home available any time I want is good. So the increasing dependence on AI as a tutor. I still think that the teacher has a role, but it may be diminished with AI now.",
