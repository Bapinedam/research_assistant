    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is able to construct feedback in an incredibly constructive manner, with step by step instructions for improvement and you can ask for further feedback if needed in a timely way that you can't get from your teacher. Furthermore GenAI draws its information from a more up to date and wide source than a teacher and this is best for most up to date learning.",
