    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI allowed more flexible learning, where I could initiate a conversation with GenAI to receive further feedback and input. Teacher learning doesn't always allow further questions and conversations. However, GenAI did not always give accurate and clear answers to questions and did not always respond to task requests in a way that furthered learning.",
