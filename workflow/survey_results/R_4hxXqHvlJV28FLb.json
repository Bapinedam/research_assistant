    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The main difference is that teachers could impact your learning through a more specific and narrow perspective; its basis is more systematic, as from their experience point of view they could point out what you haven't learnt. While GenAI usually answer you in a relatively broad and abstract sense. It could give u very specific instruction on some topic and some weakness found, but systematic training? better learn how to pre-prompt and setting for most of the people.",
