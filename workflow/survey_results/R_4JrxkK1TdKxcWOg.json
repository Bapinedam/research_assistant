    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "While most of the feedback from lecturers and/or tutors only comes after the assignments are submitted, GenAI provides me with some formative feedback during different steps of my assignment progress, etc. This impacts my learning a lot because I can see the areas where I can improve. Many times, feedback from educators is also very vague and not specific; in contrast, with GenAI, I can also it to provide more detailed feedback, but sometimes it is hard to know what exactly to ask to get specific and useful feedback.",

    "Response": "As I said before, most feedback from educators only comes when the assessment is submitted, so I felt many times that I could not use their feedback as I was not given the opportunity to resubmit my work.\nWith GenAI, I feel more confident that my word in on the right track.",
