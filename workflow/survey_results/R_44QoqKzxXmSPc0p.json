    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "the biggest difference to how this impacted my learning would be that GenAI feedback is instant, whereas feedback from a teacher takes a certain amount of time. this impacts my learning as in my degree, i am completing weekly lab reports on different content, however a big part of marking is the structure of a lab report and skills which need to be reciprocated in each report to gain full marks. most of the time, i am submitting another lab report before even receiving feedback from the last one, so an error i made in one report may carry through for a multitude of my submissions, leading to me losing more marks than needed",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "not necessarily, although GenAI will usually state something like \"this is a great detailed response...\" whereas teacher feedback is more minimal speech and a bit blunt at times",
