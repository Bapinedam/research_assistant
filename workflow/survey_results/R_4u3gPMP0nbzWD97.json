    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "My educators generally provide more details in their feedback versus AI feedback. However, sometimes educators may have limited time and energy to look through every part of my submitted work; educators may be good at pointing out room for improvement but can be less comprehensive compared to AI.",
