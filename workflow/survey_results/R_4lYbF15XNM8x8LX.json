    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Some of the teachers that I've had were wrong about things. Just to be clear, I don't expect a teacher to always be right, but they were wrong, unable to accept it, unable to reflect, and ultimately stood firmly between me and what I was trying to learn. AI doesn't do that. I might not always find the answers but I can always ask more questions get instructive and comprehensive feedback and ultimately learn.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Yes. Feedback from a tutor is often lacking in depth by comparison, feedback from a lecturer often feels rushed (fair, they have another lecture to deliver), whereas feedback from an AI is deep, interactive, and instructive (albeit it may not have adequate context to offer perspectives for marks).",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I covered feedback from tutors and lecturers, feedback from a professor feels like an imposition because they realistically other systems exist to answer standard questions and they don't have time to lend their perspective to the less standard questions. AI on the other hand doesn't have somewhere else to be, it has time to indulge lengthy tangents (often resulting in a much better understanding at the end) and has the depth of knowledge to guide you through them, can get back to you within seconds if you're at home, and can be asked to guide you without giving the answers away.",
