    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I just submit my work through my turnitin and wait for anything to be flagged as potential plagiarism, and wait for my assessment markers to provide their feedback accordingly. I understand that GenAI could actually provide me lots of insight and information, however, as my lecturers are the ones who know specifically what they are looking for, I prefer to receive feedback from them.",
