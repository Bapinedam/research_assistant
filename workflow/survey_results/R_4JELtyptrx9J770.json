    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI allows students to confidently ask questions they have without hesitation. It is also viewed as more knowledgeable than some of the teachers. The data that GenAI has are always updated and refined beyond the capabilities of teachers. The explanation techniques are also better.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teachers' feedback is not specific and sometimes can be seen as biased and non-reliable. At the same time, GenAI provides constructive feedback that reflects against the rubric and provides a proper way to improve as well as examples, unlike teachers who write generalised feedback and give bad grades without giving proper ways to improve.",
