    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I could rely on the teacher a lot more since they were the ones marking assessments and teaching us the content. Thus, their advice were most relied upon, hence I put more significance to their words. Likewise, teachers impact my learning directly in this way. On the other hand, I've only used GenAI for assistance or feedback, not specific instructions. I only used them as an assisting tool and always asked the teacher first before getting help from AI.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI was more \"structured\" and I found that it was often not specific to my assessment/goals/tasks. So, I usually don't feel too trusting of the feedback AI gives me. On the other hand, with regards to teachers, I know with more certainty that their feedback is more reliable.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI gives me feedback in the form that I actually prefer, which is written form. I also find it very convenient as I can access it anytime of the day at any moment, whereas, with teachers, I would need to construct an email question or find them in person to ask my question, which takes more effort and time.",
