    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Confident in my own writing abilities, and I believe it crosses a line, the same way as involving any third party outside of the university support system would - i.e. you can get draft feedback from a learning adviser because they will know where to direct you, without doing it for you.  Gen AI does not have that ethical/formative line.",
