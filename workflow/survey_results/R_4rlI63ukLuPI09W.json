    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "It never occured to me use GenAI for feedback on my work if im using it I will normally use it to construct a solution and then call it there. I will certianly try this in the future. Often times I feel the feedback is not necessary as in work/uni settings the goal is clear so you use GenAi to help form a solution",
