    "Question": "Why didn’t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Word’s grammar and spellchecker are enough for me, and by asking GenAI to give feedback, it takes what I’ve worked hard to complete into its amalgamation of information to share with other people who may have not worked as independently of AI and also GenAI only has a narrow view of what is a ‘good’ response- that’s just how computers work - and so whatever feedback it gives will just be seeking to make my work more like what it would consider ‘good work’, ie, its work.",
