    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Generative AI feedback is often focused on the quality of language and expression, however sometimes the overall cohesion or message can get muddied. From a teacher, their focus is moreso on the content, and thus their feedback helps me understand where I may have misinterpreted information more than where I could structure a sentence better.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Generative AI can be instructed to deliver feedback in a particular way, which can be helpful for mitigating stress or negative emotions upon receiving feedback. However, I think receiving feedback from teachers with varying communication styles is better for understanding how different people interpret work.",
