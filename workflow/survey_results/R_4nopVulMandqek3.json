    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is more readily accessible than teacher feedback. Meaning, when I require aid or feedback I am able to more promptly and efficiently interact with AI rather than taking up a lectures time. Though, if I have a question I do not feel GenAI has or can adequately answer, I will reach out to my teaching staff. However, I can be hesitant in doing so as I feel that I am wasting their time.",
