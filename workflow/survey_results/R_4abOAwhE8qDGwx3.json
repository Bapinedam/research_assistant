  "Question 40": {
    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I think because GenAI acquires a larger library of options and complexity - it really stretches your limit on what can be done with your work, whilst also seeing what examples it might have. With teachers, it definitely becomes more impactful as individuals with experience and their own opinions, they can come to a more streamlined opinion on your work and where to improve.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It could be just the interpersonal difference, where with GenAI you feel less 'convicted' for making a mistake whereas hearing it from your teacher makes it a bit scarier in thinking about your overall performance.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I think just availability, you can use GenAI at any point in time, which works much better with different schedules whereas you can only reach out to your teacher at certain times and may not always be convenient.",
