    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "I have only ever really used GenAI for proofreading / tone correction when writing a report etc. I will generally use some of the changes it suggests, but they are generally not very impactful. I can definitely say GenAI has not had an impact on my learning.\n\nAll of my notes and content I get comes from my teachers, and they are the ones who are contributing to my learning. Hence I would say teachers have the largest impact on my learning, while AI has very little / none.",

    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It feels actually useful when coming from a teacher, whereas I never really trust what AI is telling me, and always end up doing the manual work to check what it is saying.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "GenAI provides very general, and surface level feedback. Often it is generic and not really specific to what I am doing.\n\nComparatively, teachers can provide useful, in depth insights that are actually relevant to what I am learning.",
