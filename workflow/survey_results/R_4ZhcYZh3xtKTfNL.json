    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI lacks perspective, whereas with a teacher, they know more about the criterias I need to meet in order to get the quality I want. It is also harder to explain to GenAI about the rubric and what I actually need to achieve.",
