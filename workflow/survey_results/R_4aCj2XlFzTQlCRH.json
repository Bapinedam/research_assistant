    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "It just doesn't seem to be very useful and I don't trust it. I really want to use AI responsibly. Once I used it to help me with a sentence I was struggling with. It did help me find an entrance into writing a better sentence. I also struggle with tenses so I've thought of running my writing through an AI program but I'm not sure of the implications of that. I need further training.",
