  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "As a student, I've found that learning from GenAI and my teacher each has distinct benefits. GenAI offers instant access to a vast range of information and can explain concepts in various ways until I understand, which is incredibly helpful for quick clarifications. However, my teacher brings a personal touch, understanding my unique learning style, and can provide real-time feedback and encouragement, fostering a more engaging and interactive learning environment. Combining both sources has significantly enriched my learning experience, balancing the breadth of GenAI with the tailored guidance of my teacher.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "The feedback from GenAI is immediate and extensive, providing detailed answers and explanations based on a vast database of information. This helps me quickly find answers to specific questions and understand a broad range of topics. In contrast, feedback from my teacher is more personalized and context-aware. My teacher can assess my strengths and weaknesses, offering targeted advice and insights that address my individual learning needs. Additionally, the teacherâ€™s feedback often includes emotional support and motivation, fostering a more supportive learning atmosphere that GenAI cannot replicate.",
