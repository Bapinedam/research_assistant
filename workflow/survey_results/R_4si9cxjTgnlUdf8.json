    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI provides a more general approach to problems unless all information has been explicitly provided to it. This is sometimes good or bad depending on how accurate I need the information to be. Getting teachers feedback is always better as it will always be accurate and catered towards the task at hand. A disadvantage is the response time, with AI you get an answer instantly but with getting a teachers response it can sometimes take a whole day or a few days.",
