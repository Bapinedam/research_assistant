    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Teacher feedback (especially in classes not so much from assessments as a lot of it can be very generalized) is very helpful and reliable! \nAI feedback is not the most reliable so you always need to take it with a grain of salt, it’s also sometimes just completely wrong",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Not really, most uni lectures that I have had also aren’t the best at giving feedback so sometimes it feels as helpful as AI (which is about 50% helpful) but teacher feedback is usually significantly more relevant and reliable",
