    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI is really only an idea, I often still crosscheck its suggestions which does take longer but also encourages self-driven learning. Feedback from teachers are more reliable and often more specific but can sometimes be a little bit limited due to time constraints.",
