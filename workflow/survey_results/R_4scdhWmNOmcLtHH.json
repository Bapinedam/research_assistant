    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "It doesn't make a huge impact. GenAI is favorable in this instance as the AI is available at an instant and can substitute when a tutor is unavailable in certain hours of the day, especially when students are rushing their assignment last hour.",
