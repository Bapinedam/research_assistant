    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "GenAI provided quick, broad feedback that was helpful for immediate clarification but often lacked depth. My university teacher's feedback was personalized, leading to a deeper understanding and more meaningful learning. The teacher's guidance also offered motivation, which GenAI couldn't replicate. Overall, the teacher's feedback had a stronger impact on my learning",
