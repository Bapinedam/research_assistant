    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI allows me to ask questions anytime and anywhere. I can even take a screenshot of a small detail from a PowerPoint slide and ask about it. However, if I ask the instructor, I worry that he might think these silly questions are a waste of his time. To leave a good impression on the teacher, I ask AI about simple questions that I could find in the books with some time, which is very efficient.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "When communicating with a teacher, I need to follow social etiquette and wait for a response, but they often provide deeper answers based on their extensive knowledge. With AI, I just need to ask a simple question and get a response within two seconds, but the answer tends to be more superficial.",
