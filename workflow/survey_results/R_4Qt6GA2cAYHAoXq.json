    "Question": "Please describe any differences in how it impacted your learning (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The GenAI also gave a sample on the work I have done with the suggested feedback which was quite useful. The teacher feedback usually is more direct and on what was missed. The AI wouldn't know this unless you also tell it what the teacher said as well or what the question was to give it more context.",

  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "Both were fairly fine. I take the teachers feedback with more weight because they actually know what the assignment is about and I sometimes use GenAI in order to get more feedback on how to improve which does make me feel happy that I live in a time when GenAI just started",
