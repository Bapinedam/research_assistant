    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "The feedback I received from my teacher made me feel relieved, as it was reliable. On the other hand, AI's feedback was not as reliable, therefore leaving a sense of insecurity about the assignment, making me think what if there are other issues the AI was not able to identify?",

    "Response": "The feedback I received from my teacher helped me know exactly what was needed to be done and where my research lacked. Leading to more subject-appropriate research by me. Whereas AI was only able to provide general feedback.",
