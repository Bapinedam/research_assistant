    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "I had no idea that was possible, but I can see how it would be very helpful, especially since universities do not provide enough support, particularly to online students who are limited to office visits for inquiries. Online studying is the only way to make education feasible for many. Additionally, study support is extremely limited, even for extra assistance for students with dyslexia like myself. I wish I had more help, so this would be very beneficial.",
