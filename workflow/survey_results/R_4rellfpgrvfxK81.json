  "Question 41": {
    "Question": "Were there any differences in how the feedback made you feel (comparing GenAI and your teacher)?",
    "Response": "AI is instant for me, and I can get immediate feedback from any question I need â€“ whether it's what I want or not. The lecturers are a bit far away from me, they also have their own jobs, for example, sometimes I need to solve some important problems in the middle of the night. It's impossible for me to bother my teacher at such times.",

  "Question 42": {
    "Question": "Describe any other differences between the feedback you received from GenAI and your teacher.",
    "Response": "I always feel very inhibited when I receive feedback from my lecturers, because I am afraid that the questions I ask will appear ignorant, but I don't have this kind of trouble in the face of AI, and I can easily ask even stupid questions.",
