    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because I wasn't confident in the accuracy of the feedback it could provide or if it would match what the teacher is looking for. I would prefer to ask a teacher, however I understand a teacher may not always be available therefore ChatGPT may be quicker and easier to access the feedback.",
