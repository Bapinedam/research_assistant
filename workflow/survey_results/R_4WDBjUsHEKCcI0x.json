    "Question": "Why didnâ€™t you use GenAI for feedback on your work?",
    "Response": "Because, when I work, I am also learning, and at the end, I should be the one deciding what to include, which tone and how my work satisfies my understanding. So, I don't need an AI to provide a feedback as the only one feedback I want to get is from the course Instructor.",
