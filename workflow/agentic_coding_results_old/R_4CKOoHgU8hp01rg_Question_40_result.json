The original output adhered to this rule, so no changes were needed here.\n\n2. **Theme and Sub-theme Alignment**:\n   - The original output correctly mapped the student’s statements to the appropriate themes and sub-themes. For example, \"Provides instant feedback\" was correctly coded under \"Processes > Access > Speed,\" and \"lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning preferences\" was correctly coded under \"Relational > Relational > Personal.\"\n\n3. **Effort Code Clarification**:\n   - The original output incorrectly described AI feedback as requiring \"less effort\" when the statement actually implies that AI feedback requires **more effort** for self-learning. This was corrected to align with the coding strategy.\n\n4. **Reasoning Refinement**:\n   - Some reasoning statements were slightly vague or inconsistent with the coding strategy. For example, the reasoning for \"Less effort\" under AI feedback was clarified to emphasize the contrast between self-learning and guided learning.\n\n5. **Surface-Level Understanding**:\n   - The revised output avoids over-interpretation and adheres to the surface-level meaning of the student’s statements, as required by the coding strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- Corrected the interpretation of \"Effort\" for AI feedback.\n- Refined reasoning statements for clarity and alignment with the coding strategy.\n- Ensured all codes adhered to the Actor + Comparator + Characteristic logic.\n\nThis revised output is now fully aligned with the coding strategy and accurately reflects the student’s response.",

Below is a revised version of the output, with corrections and justifications for each code:\n\n---\n\n### Revised Output:\n\n```json\n{\n    \"codes\": [\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"A\",\n            \"comparator\": \"More\",\n            \"theme\": \"Processes\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Access\",\n            \"code\": \"Speed\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The phrase 'Provides instant feedback' directly maps to the Speed code, as it highlights the immediacy of AI feedback compared to teachers.\"\n        },\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"A\",\n            \"comparator\": \"Less\",\n            \"theme\": \"Information\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Quality\",\n            \"code\": \"In-depth\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The statement 'it may not delve deeply into why something is correct or incorrect' explicitly indicates that AI feedback lacks depth, which aligns with the In-depth code.\"\n        },\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"T\",\n            \"comparator\": \"More\",\n            \"theme\": \"Information\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Quality\",\n            \"code\": \"In-depth\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The description 'fosters a deeper understanding' and 'provides context, explain thought processes' directly indicates that teacher feedback is more comprehensive and nuanced, aligning with the In-depth code.\"\n        },\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"T\",\n            \"comparator\": \"More\",\n            \"theme\": \"Sense-making\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Understanding\",\n            \"code\": \"Understanding\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The statement 'helps with mastering difficult topics and long-term retention' suggests that teacher feedback enhances understanding, which aligns with the Understanding code.\"\n        },\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"A\",\n            \"comparator\": \"Less\",\n            \"theme\": \"Relational\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Relational\",\n            \"code\": \"Personal\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The phrase 'lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning preferences' indicates that AI feedback is less personalized, which aligns with the Personal code.\"\n        },\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"T\",\n            \"comparator\": \"More\",\n            \"theme\": \"Relational\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Relational\",\n            \"code\": \"Personal\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The statement 'Can tailor feedback to your personal learning preferences' explicitly highlights the personalized nature of teacher feedback, aligning with the Personal code.\"\n        },\n        {   \n            \"actor\": \"A\",\n            \"comparator\": \"Less\",\n            \"theme\": \"Processes\",\n            \"sub_theme\": \"Effort\",\n            \"code\": \"Less effort\",\n            \"reasoning\": \"The statement 'Encourages a degree of self-learning and exploration' implies that AI feedback requires students to put in more effort to interpret and apply it, contrasting with guided learning.

The original output adhered to this rule, so no changes were needed here.\n\n2. **Theme and Sub-theme Alignment**:\n   - The original output correctly mapped the student’s statements to the appropriate themes and sub-themes. For example, \"Provides instant feedback\" was correctly coded under \"Processes > Access > Speed,\" and \"lacks the nuanced understanding of your individual learning preferences\" was correctly coded under \"Relational > Relational > Personal.\"\n\n3. **Effort Code Clarification**:\n   - The original output incorrectly described AI feedback as requiring \"less effort\" when the statement actually implies that AI feedback requires **more effort** for self-learning. This was corrected to align with the coding strategy.\n\n4. **Reasoning Refinement**:\n   - Some reasoning statements were slightly vague or inconsistent with the coding strategy. For example, the reasoning for \"Less effort\" under AI feedback was clarified to emphasize the contrast between self-learning and guided learning.\n\n5. **Surface-Level Understanding**:\n   - The revised output avoids over-interpretation and adheres to the surface-level meaning of the student’s statements, as required by the coding strategy.\n\n---\n\n### Summary of Changes:\n- Corrected the interpretation of \"Effort\" for AI feedback.\n- Refined reasoning statements for clarity and alignment with the coding strategy.\n- Ensured all codes adhered to the Actor + Comparator + Characteristic logic.\n\nThis revised output is now fully aligned with the coding strategy and accurately reflects the student’s response."
