The Objective code is suitable as it reflects feedback that is impartial and fact-based.  \n\n3. **Actor: T, Comparator: More, Theme: Information, Sub-theme: Quality, Code: In-depth**  \n   - **Reasoning:** The reasoning accurately connects \"provided more detailed explanations\" to the In-depth code.
