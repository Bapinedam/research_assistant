Here's a breakdown of why it is a good example:\n\n1. **Theme, Sub-theme, and Code Selection**:\n   - The first reason correctly identifies \"Processes → Access → Unaware\" because the student explicitly mentions not having thought about using GenAI, which reflects a lack of awareness or consideration.\n   - The second reason appropriately uses \"Information → Quality → Trustworthy\" as the student explicitly states being \"unsure on trusting AI,\" which directly aligns with doubts about the reliability or credibility of AI feedback.\n\n2. **Reasoning**:\n   - The reasoning for each code is concise and directly references the triggering phrases from the student's response. It ties these phrases to the definitions provided in the coding strategy.\n\n3. **Usability**:\n   - Both chunks are usable as they clearly state reasons for not using GenAI. The response avoids any off-topic or unintelligible content.\n\nThis output is a good example of how to apply the coding strategy effectively.
